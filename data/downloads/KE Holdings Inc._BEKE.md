## 风险因素 (Item 1A)

/b> Summary of Risk Factors An investment in our ADSs involves significant risks. Below is a summary of material risks we face, organized under relevant headings. These risks are discussed more fully in Item 3. Key InformationD. Risk Factors. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Our business is susceptible to fluctuations in Chinas housing related industry. 20 Table of Contents Our business is subject to government regulations and policies guiding Chinas economy in general and, specifically, on existing and new home sales and home rentals. If we are unable to continue to provide satisfactory experience to customers, our business and reputation may be materially and adversely affected. We may not succeed in continuing to maintain, protect and strengthen our brands, and any negative publicity about us, our business, our management, our business partners or the housing related industry in general may materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and growth. If our platform is unable to continue to offer comprehensive authentic property listings, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We have a limited operating history under our platform business model, and our historical growth and performance may not be indicative of our future growth and financial results. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with the anti-monopoly and competition laws and regulations in the PRC may result in governmental investigations, enforcement actions, litigation or claims against us and could have an adverse effect on business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Our business generates and processes a large amount of data and is subject to various evolving PRC laws and regulations regarding cybersecurity and data privacy. Failure of cybersecurity and data privacy concerns could subject us to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences, and deter current and potential customers from using our services. We cannot guarantee that our monetization strategies will be successfully implemented or generate sustainable revenues and profit. We incurred net losses in the past, and we may not be able to remain profitable or increase profitability in the future. Our business is sensitive to economic conditions. A severe or prolonged downturn in the global or Chinese economy could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure KE Holdings Inc. is not an operating company in China but a Cayman Islands holding company with no material operations of its own and does not have a majority of equity ownership in the VIEs. We conduct our operations primarily through (i) our PRC subsidiaries and (ii) the VIEs, with which we maintain contractual agreements. Investors in our ADSs thus are not purchasing equity interest in the VIEs in China but instead are purchasing equity interest in KE Holdings Inc., a Cayman Islands holding company. If the PRC government finds that the agreements that establish the structure for operating our business do not comply with PRC laws and regulations, or if these regulations or their interpretations change in the future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations. Our holding company in the Cayman Islands, the VIEs and investors of our company face uncertainty about potential future actions by the PRC government that could affect the enforceability of the contractual arrangements with the VIEs and, consequently, significantly affect the financial performance of the VIEs and our company as a group. See Item 3. Key InformationD. Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Corporate StructureIf the PRC government finds that the agreements that establish the structure for operating some of our operations in China do not comply with PRC regulations relating to the relevant industries, or if these regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations change in the future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations. 21 Table of Contents We rely on contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their shareholders to direct activities of the VIEs that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIEs and receive economic benefits from the VIEs that could be significant to the VIEs, which may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing operational control. See Item 3. Key InformationD. Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Corporate StructureWe rely on contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their shareholders to direct activities of the VIEs that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIEs and receive economic benefits from the VIEs that could be significant to the VIEs, which may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing operational control. Any failure by the VIEs or their shareholders to perform their obligations under our contractual arrangements with them would have a material and adverse effect on part of our business. See Item 3. Key InformationD. Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Corporate StructureAny failure by the VIEs or their shareholders to perform their obligations under our contractual arrangements with them would have a material and adverse effect on part of our business. Risks Related to Doing Business in China Changes in Chinas economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. See Item 3. Key InformationD. Risk FactorsRisks Related to Doing Business in ChinaChanges in Chinas economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. Evolvements of the PRC legal system, including risks that rules and regulations can change quickly with little advance notice and the enforcement practice of rules and regulations may vary, could result in uncertainties that could have a material adverse change in our operations and the value of our ADSs. See Item 3. Key InformationD. Risk FactorsRisks Related to Doing Business in ChinaThe PRC legal system is evolving, which leads to uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect us. The PRC governments oversight and discretion over our business operations could result in a material adverse change in our operations and the value of our securities. The Chinese government may intervene or influence our operations at any time, or may exert more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers, and has implemented, and may continue to implement, regulatory requirements. Our failure to meet such requirements could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our securities. See Item 3. Key InformationD. Risk FactorsRisks Related to Doing Business in ChinaThe PRC governments oversight and discretion over our business operations could result in a material adverse change in our operations and the value of our securities. F ilings, approvals or other administration requirements of the CSRC, the CAC or other PRC governmental authorities may be required in connection with our future offshore offerings under PRC law. Any actions by the Chinese government to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. See Item 3. Key InformationD. Risk FactorsRisks Related to Doing Business in ChinaFilings, approvals or other administration requirements of the CSRC, the CAC or other PRC governmental authorities may be required in connection with our future offshore offerings under PRC law. The PCAOB had historically been unable to inspect our auditor in relation to their audit work performed for our financial statements and the inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections over our auditor in the past has deprived our investors with the benefits of such inspections. See Item 3. Key InformationD. Risk FactorsRisks Related to Doing Business in ChinaThe PCAOB had historically been unable to inspect our auditor in relation to their audit work performed for our financial statements and the inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections over our auditor in the past has deprived our investors with the benefits of such inspections. 22 Table of Contents Our ADSs may be prohibited from trading in the United States under the HFCAA in the future if the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely auditors located in China. The delisting of the ADSs, or the threat of their being delisted, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment. In May 2022, in connection with its implementation of the HFCAA, the SEC conclusively named our company as a Commission-Identified Issuer following the filing of our companys 2021 Form 20-F. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB removed mainland China and Hong Kong from the list of jurisdictions where it is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms. As of the date of this annual report, the PCAOB has not issued any new determination that it is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in any jurisdiction. For this reason, we were not identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer under the HFCAA after we filed the annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 or 2023 and do not expect to be so identified after we file this annual report on Form 20-F. See Item 3. Key InformationD. Risk FactorsRisks Related to Doing Business in ChinaOur ADSs may be prohibited from trading in the United States under the HFCAA in the future if the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely auditors located in China. The delisting of the ADSs, or the threat of their being delisted, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment. You may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing actions against us or our directors and officers named in the annual report based on foreign laws. Substantially all of our officers and directors are located in China, and it may be difficult to enforce liabilities and enforce judgments on those individuals. See Item 3. Key InformationD. Risk FactorsRisks Related to Doing Business in ChinaYou may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing actions against us or our directors and officers named in the annual report based on foreign laws. Risks Related to Our Shares and ADSs The trading price of the ADSs and Class A ordinary shares may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to investors. Our dual-class voting structure will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could discourage others from pursuing any change of control transactions that holders of our Class A ordinary shares and ADSs may view as beneficial. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Our business is susceptible to fluctuations in Chinas housing related industry. We are susceptible to market conditions of Chinas housing related industry, where we primarily conduct our business. Chinas housing related industry has slowed down in recent years in terms of housing transaction volume and prices, and we cannot assure you that the industry will grow or maintain its current scale in the future. Chinas housing related industry are influenced by economic, social, political and other factors outside our control, including the general economic conditions and regulatory environment in China. The decline or fluctuation in the housing related industry may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, there may be situations where Chinas housing related industry becomes over-heated, and our platform becomes less appealing to customers, brokerage brands, stores and agents and other business partners, which could potentially adversely affect our business of facilitating housing transactions and services. Our home renovation and furnishing business also partly depends on the traffic referrals from the housing transactions on our platform. As a result, a slowdown in the housing related industry would have an adverse effect on our revenues from home renovation and furnishing. In addition, our home rental and other emerging business could also be adversely affected by the fluctuations in housing related industry. 23 Table of Contents Our business is subject to government regulations and policies guiding Chinas economy in general and, specifically, on existing and new home sales and home rentals. The housing related industry in China is also subject to extensive government regulations and policies. The PRC government has in recent years announced a series of measures aimed to stabilize the PRC economy and specific sectors, including the housing related industry. Moves in regulations and policies on the housing related industry were more often made during the times when the housing prices are increasing overwhelmingly, in line with the central governments principle that housing is for living in, not for speculation. This principle was clearly emphasized in the Outline of the 14th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development and the Long-Range Objectives Through the Year 2035 for the Peoples Republic of China approved by the National Peoples Congress of the PRC in March 2021. With the implementation of this plan, the PRC governmental authorities have implemented strict regulations in the real estate industry, focusing on achieving a dynamic balance between demand and supply, regulating speculative housing investment, and promoting social stabilization and welfare. During the times when the housing prices were increasing significantly, both central and local government authorities introduced various control policies to stabilize the housing related industry. In response to the highly volatile housing prices in the fourth quarter of 2020, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of the PRC, jointly with other seven PRC regulatory authorities, issued the Notice on Continuous Improvement and Regulation of the Real Estate Market Order on July 13, 2021, which aimed to strengthen the rectification of improper or illegal behaviors in real estate development, sales and leasing of properties, and property services. In 2021, several cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, introduced measures to strengthen the regulation of housing market, including advertising and sales of real estate properties, and financing for housing transactions. These measures have affected the growth rate of the housing related industry, and some have dissuaded potential purchasers from making purchases, causing a decline in transaction volumes and average selling prices in both existing home sales and new home sales in 2021. Specifically, certain measures regulating the conduct of real estate developers have a particular impact on the transaction volumes and prices of new home sales. The measures in turn not only have caused reduction in our customers demand for our platform services, but also prevented real estate developers from raising the capital they need, increased their costs to start new projects, and changed the sales and marketing strategy of the developers in a way that reduces their demand for our platform services. Since the end of 2021, in response to a slowdown in the real estate industry, PRC government has made various efforts to support and stabilize the housing industry. Local government authorities have selectively eased restrictions on residential property purchases. In the second half of 2022, PRC government made targeted efforts to promote housing delivery and to resolve financing risks for real estate developers. Efforts include reducing the interest rate on individual housing loans for the purchase of the first home by an individual borrower, increasing the availability of individual housing provident fund loans for the purchase of residential properties by certain individuals and their family members, and providing tax subsidies for the purchase of residential properties by individuals and families. Starting in 2023, the PRC government continued to roll out policies to bolster the real estate sector , allowing local governments to adjust and ease control policies according to regional market conditions. Accordingly, various measures were introduced in different cities in China, including loosening the criteria of first-home buyers who are qualified for lower down-payment ratios and mortgage rates, lowering the interest rates of existing mortgages for first-home purchases and extending tax incentives for residential purchases. In 2024, additional stimulus measures were implemented to stabilize the real estate market, including reducing mortgage down payments ratios, removing the mortgage rate floor, lowering housing provident fund loan rates, and easing quota restrictions for all home unit. The PRC governmental authorities have also eased restrictions on home buying in major cities. For instance, starting in late September 2024, non-residents in Beijing became eligible to purchase properties in core residential areas within the fifth ring road provided they had paid at least three years of social insurance or personal income tax, down from the previous requirements of five years. On April 27, 2023, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development and the State Administration for Market Regulation jointly promulgated the Opinions on Regulating Real Estate Brokerage Services which advocate real estate agencies to reasonably reduce the service fees of housing sales and rental brokerage and propose to guide both sellers and buyers of transactions to share the brokerage service fee. We have made corresponding adjustments in certain cities. For example, in September 2023, we reduced commission rate for existing home transactions in Beijing and the fee is split equally between sellers and buyers. The PRC governmental authorities may continue to adopt new laws, regulations and policies from time to time with an aim to stabilize and support the long-term healthy development of the housing related industry in certain regions in China, which might potentially affect our business. 24 Table of Contents In addition, the PRC governmental authorities have imposed certain criteria to regulate the home rental market. For example, the State Council of the PRC promulgated the Opinions of the General Office of the State Council on Accelerating the Cultivation and Development of the Home-Rental Market in 2016, which require the local housing authorities to strengthen the administration of the home-rental market participants, including residential tenancy enterprises, intermediary agencies and professionals, in coordination with other departments, and keep credit records of market participants. Furthermore, the Opinions on Strengthening Regulation on Light-asset Residential Rental Enterprises, published in April 2021, set out regulatory measures on various aspects, including standards of qualification, online registration and filing of business operation, limitation and supervision on utilization of loans and monitoring of rents. In addition, at the municipal level, many municipal governments issued regulations in relation to home rental business. For instance, in May 2022, the local authorities in Beijing issued the Regulations of Beijing on the Rental of Residential Properties, which impose specified requirements on home rental business and conducting home rental related business on internet information platforms. If the PRC governmental authorities adopt stricter measures or policies with respect to rental housing, or the interpretation of current laws and regulations relating to the home rental market becomes more restrictive and rigorous, they may depress the home rental market, incur additional expenses, dissuade potential tenants from renting properties, and cause a decline in average rental rates. Our business may be materially and adversely affected as a result of decreased demand of rental properties and increasing expenses that may result from government policies. We cannot assure you that the existing restrictive policies and measures will be eased or lifted in the future, nor can we assure you that the PRC government will not adopt additional and more stringent industry policies, regulations and measures in line with the changes of the real estate market. Changes in government policies may also create uncertainty that could affect the sentiment of potential investors in real estate. If these changes in government policies result in decreasing transaction volumes in the housing related industry in China or require us to make necessary changes to our businesses in compliance of new regulations and policies, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the existing and future government regulations and policies may positively or negatively affect different segments of our business operations in varied ways and degrees, such as restricting our business practices and fee rates. As a result, we may adjust our strategies and business models in response to the evolving regulations and policies. We cannot assure you that these adjustments will be successful or materialize in positive business prospects and financial performance. If we are unable to continue to provide satisfactory experience to customers, our business and reputation may be materially and adversely affected. The success of our business substantially hinges on our ability to provide quality customer experience, which in turn depends on a variety of factors, including our ability to continue to offer integrated online and offline access to an extensive and authentic property listing database and to, together with the brokerage brands, stores and agents on our platform, provide convenient and secure housing transactions and services experience and satisfactory services to our customers. Interruptions or failures in the proper functioning of our platform hamper our delivery of satisfactory customer experience. These interruptions may be due to unforeseen events that are beyond our control or the control of the participants on our platform such as intensified competition due to market entry of new players with financial and other resources stronger than us, additional regulatory requirements which we cannot satisfy on a timely basis, or at all, or adverse development or negative publicity involving our platform participants. Moreover, although we endeavor to implement various service protocols and train the real estate agents and other related service providers on our platform to ensure the quality of their service, we cannot guarantee that we will effectively manage all the agents and other service providers to ensure satisfactory customer experience in all service settings. We have received customer complaints about various services on our platform from time to time. If we are unable to continue to provide satisfactory customer experience, customers may choose other service providers over our platform for their intended housing transactions and services, which could materially and adversely impact our reputation, business and results of operations. 25 Table of Contents We may not succeed in continuing to maintain, protect and strengthen our brands, and any negative publicity about us, our business, our management, our business partners or the housing related industry in general may materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and growth. We believe that the recognition and reputation of our brands among real estate agents, customers, real estate developers and the industry in general have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Our ability to maintain, protect and strengthen our brands is critical to our market position. Maintaining and strengthening our brands will likely depend significantly on, among others, our ability to provide high-quality housing transaction services on our platform. We market our brands through efforts such as word-of-mouth marketing, sponsoring events, advertising and marketing through a variety of media. These efforts may not always achieve the desired results. If we fail to maintain a strong brand, our business, results of operations and prospects will be materially and adversely affected. Our reputation and brands may be impacted by various factors, some of which are difficult or impossible to predict or control and costly or impossible to remediate. Negative publicity about us, such as alleged misconduct by our employees, connected agents or other business partners on our platform, inauthentic property listings on our platform, unethical business practices, rumors relating to our business, management, employees, real estate agents on our platform, our shareholders and affiliates, our business partners or our competitors and peers, or negative publicity about other companies that use similar brand names as ours, can harm our reputation, business and results of operations. These allegations, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents, may lead to inquiries, regulatory investigations or legal actions against us. Such actions could substantially damage our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs to defend ourselves. Any negative public perception or publicity regarding our business partners that we cooperate with, or any regulatory inquiries or investigations and lawsuits initiated against them, may also have an adverse impact on our brand and reputation. Moreover, any negative media publicity about the housing transactions and services industry, service quality problems of other players in our industry, including our competitors, or even negative sentiments against China-based listed companies as a group due to fraud or misbehavior of certain bad actors, may also negatively impact our reputation and undermine the trust and credibility of our platform. If we fail to maintain positive reputation, our ability to attract and retain customers, real estate agents, business partners and key employees could be harmed. If our platform is unable to continue to offer comprehensive authentic property listings, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We believe that our authentic property listings inventory is critical for us to gain trust from our housing customers, improve agent operating efficiency and maintain our competitive advantages. We have an obligation under PRC laws to review, monitor and verify the content of the listing information to ensure it is not fraudulent or misleading and is in compliance with applicable laws. We are not allowed to list certain property information for various reasons, including intellectual property infringement, non-compliance with real estate regulations and policies and non-compliance with advertising laws and competition laws, and we are legally required to delete such listing information that is reported by our customers as illegal or may constitute an infringement to others. Although we thrive to maintain the authenticity and accuracy of our property listings by enforcing strict authentic listing rules, constantly monitoring and checking the authenticity of property listings, timely updating or deleting unqualified listings and awarding customers for accurate reporting of incorrect information, we cannot assure you that all the real estate properties listed on our platform are authentic, accurate, up-to-date and not misleading at all times. See Item 4. Information on the CompanyB. Business OverviewAgent Cooperation Network (ACN)Authentic Property Listings. To the extent we fail to monitor and maintain the quality and authenticity of the listings in our property listing database, and the authenticity and accuracy of our property listings deteriorate, our platform could be less attractive to both housing customers and real estate agents and our transaction volume may decrease. We may also be subject to regulatory investigations or penalties if the issues raise regulatory concerns. A public perception that inauthentic property information is displayed on our platform, even if factually incorrect or based on a few isolated incidents, could damage our reputation, diminish the value of our brand and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 26 Table of Contents We have a limited operating history under our platform business model, and our historical growth and performance may not be indicative of our future growth and financial results. Although we have a long and successful operating track record in operating Lianjia , we have a limited history for operating Beike platform which was launched in 2018. Although we have experienced a relatively high growth in operating Beike platform, we have historically experienced decrease in our GTV from 2021 to 2022. While our GTV increased from RMB2,609.6 billion in 2022 to RMB3,142.9 billion in 2023, and further increased to RMB3,349.4 billion (US$458.9 billion) in 2024, we may experience decrease in our business from time to time. You should not consider our historical growth and profitability as indicative of our future financial performance. We officially launched our home renovation and furnishing services, Beiwoo , in April 2020, and completed the acquisition of Shengdu in April 2022, and our Carefree Rent business was developed at scale during the second half of 2022. In 2023, we have upgraded our corporate strategy to One Body, Three Wings to add Beihaojia business as a third wing to facilitate supply-side upgrades for new homes. The business model of Beihaojia is at an early stage and subject to changes. These new businesses have their ramp-up periods, and our strategies may not be carried as planned and the growth of these businesses may be limited by factors out of our control. You should consider our future operations in light of the challenges and uncertainties that we may encounter, which include our ability to, among other things: navigate an uncertain and evolving regulatory environment and adapt our operations to new policies, regulations and measures that may come into effect from time to time; develop our infrastructure to enhance service efficiency and customer experience; attract real estate brokerage brands and their affiliated stores and agents, real estate developers, other service providers as well as customers to our platform, and retain existing platform participants; continue to implement and optimize our ACN rules; continue to develop our technology and enhance our data insights; maintain an extensive and authentic property listing database on our platform; manage a large base of geographically dispersed employees, agents, customers and business partners; deliver compelling value propositions to participants on our platform and ecosystem; position our products and services in a commercially sound way; expand service or product offerings and expand into new businesses, including home renovation and furnishing business, home rental business and Beihaojia business; and realize the contemplated synergies from our completed or proposed acquisitions. If the demand for completing housing transactions and services on an integrated offline and online platform does not develop as we expect, or if we fail to enhance efficiency and customer experience as we expect, our business and financial conditions may be materially and adversely affected. 27 Table of Contents Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with the anti-monopoly and competition laws and regulations in the PRC may result in governmental investigations, enforcement actions, litigation or claims against us and could have an adverse effect on business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The PRC anti-monopoly regulators have in recent years strengthened enforcement under the anti-monopoly and competition laws and regulations. In March 2018, the State Administration for Market Regulation of the PRC was formed as a new governmental agency to take over, among other things, the anti-monopoly enforcement functions from the departments under the Ministry of Commerce, the National Development and Reform Commission of the PRC, or the NDRC, and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce of the PRC (the predecessor of the State Administration for Market Regulation), respectively. On November 18, 2021, the State Council of the PRC inaugurated the National Anti-Monopoly Bureau, which aims to further implement the fair competition policies and strengthen anti-monopoly supervision in the PRC, especially to strengthen supervision and law enforcement in areas involving platform economy, innovation, science and technology, information security and peoples well-being. The PRC anti-monopoly regulators may also issue implementation rules or guidelines from time to time to reinforce their regulation on certain industrial sectors. On February 7, 2021, the Anti-Monopoly Committee of the State Council of the PRC published the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for the Platform Economy Sector, which are aimed at enhancing anti-monopoly administration on businesses that operate under the platform model and the overall platform economy. The Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for the Platform Economy Sector are consistent with the PRC Anti-Monopoly Law and prohibit monopolistic conduct such as entering into monopoly agreements, abusing a dominant market position and concentration of undertakings that has or may have the effect of precluding or restricting competition in the field of platform economy. More specifically, the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for the Platform Economy Sector outline certain practices that may, if without justifiable reasons, constitute abuse of dominant market position, including without limitation, discriminating customers in terms of pricing and other transactional conditions using big data and analytics, coercing counterparties into exclusivity arrangements, using technology means to block competitors interface, favorable positioning in search results of goods displays, using bundled services to sell services or products, compulsory collection of unnecessary user data. In addition, the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for the Platform Economy Sector reinforce anti-monopoly merger review for internet platform related transactions to safeguard market competition and stipulate that any concentration of undertakings involving variable interest entities is subject to anti-monopoly review. The guidelines also specify various types of agreements in the platform economy which may constitute monopoly agreements. On April 25, 2024, Anti - Monopoly Compliance Guideline for Operators was further updated, which requires, under the PRC Anti - Monopoly Law, operators to establish anti - monopoly compliance management system to prevent anti - monopoly compliance risks. In addition, on November 15, 2021, the State Administration for Market Regulation published the Overseas Anti-Monopoly Compliance Guidelines for Enterprises, which are aimed at helping PRC companies establish and strengthen overseas anti-monopoly compliance systems to reduce overseas anti-monopoly compliance risks. The guidelines apply to both PRC enterprises that conduct business and operation overseas and PRC enterprises that conduct business and operations in the PRC and may have certain impacts on overseas markets, in particular for those that conduct import and export trade, overseas investments, acquisition, transfer or license of intellectual properties and tendering and bidding activities. 28 Table of Contents Furthermore, the Anti-Monopoly Law, which was amended in June 2022 and became effective on August 1, 2022, increases the maximum fines for illegal concentration of business operators to no more than ten percent of its last years sales revenue if the concentration of business operator has or may have an effect of excluding or limiting competitions, or a fine of up to RMB5 million if the concentration of business operator does not have an effect of excluding or limiting competition. It also provides that the authorities shall investigate a transaction where there is any evidence that the concentration has or may have the effect of eliminating or restricting competitions, even if such concentration does not reach the filing threshold. On March 10, 2023, the State Administration for Market Regulation issued the amended Provisions on the Review of Concentrations of Undertakings, the Provisions on the Prohibition of Monopoly Agreements, the Provisions on the Prohibition of Acts of Abuse of Dominant Market Position, and the Provisions on the Prohibition of Acts of Abuse of Administrative Power to Exclude or Restrict Competition, which became effective on April 15, 2023. On June 25, 2023, the State Administration for Market Regulation issued the amended Provisions Prohibiting Abuse of Intellectual Property Rights to Exclude and Restrict Competition, which came into force on August 1, 2023. These provisions provide detailed rules for the implementation of the Anti-Monopoly Law. See Item 4. Information on the CompanyB. Business OverviewRegulationRegulations Related to Anti-Monopoly and Anti-Unfair Competition. In January 2024, the State Council issued the amended Provisions of the State Council on the Threshold for the Filing of Concentration of Undertakings, which significantly increased the turnover thresholds to trigger merger control filings in mainland China. Specifically, a transaction that satisfies one of the following conditions must be notified to the State Administration for Market Regulation: (i) the aggregate turnover of all business operators concerned in the concentration exceeds RMB12 billion on a global basis (increased from the previous threshold of RMB10 billion) in the preceding financial year and each of at least two of them generated turnover in mainland China exceeds RMB800 million (increased from the previous threshold of RMB400 million) in the preceding financial year; or (ii) the aggregate turnover in mainland China of all the business operators concerned in the concentration exceeds RMB4 billion (increased from the previous threshold of RMB2 billion) in the preceding financial year and each of at least two of them generated turnover in mainland China exceeds RMB800 million (increased from the previous threshold of RMB400 million) in the preceding financial year. Accordingly, we may have to complete the anti-monopoly review procedures for our investments and acquisitions and comply with the laws and regulations in relation to anti-monopoly. There can be no assurance that we would be able to complete the applicable review procedures in a timely manner, or at all, if the proposed transaction reaches the filing threshold. Our failure to complete the applicable review procedures could result in constraints on our investments and acquisitions, which may materially and adversely affect our financial conditions, results of operations, and business prospects. As the aforementioned laws, regulations and guidelines were recently promulgated, there remain uncertainties as to how these guidelines will be implemented and whether these laws, regulations and guidelines will have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We cannot assure you that our business operations comply with such regulations and authorities requirements in all respects. If any non-compliance is raised by authorities and determined against us, we may be subject to fines and other penalties. We may be involved in investigations, inquiries, claims, complaints or other administrative requirements in relation to anti-monopoly and competition laws and regulations in the PRC from time to time, which regulate various potential monopolistic actions or arrangements, such as monopoly agreements, bundling or tie-in sales, unfair pricing practices, imposing unreasonable terms on the counterparties, requiring the operators on the platform to choose one out of two competitive platforms, charging additional and unreasonable fees, refusing to transact with certain counterparties without any reasonable ground, as well as concentrations of undertaking, and these investigations, claims and complaints are subject to the uncertainties associated with the evolving legislative activities and varied local enforcement practices. We are committed to complying with the foregoing laws, regulations and government guidelines and we continually assess and evaluate our compliance status accordingly. In the case of our failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws and regulations and new legislations or guidelines to be promulgated from time to time, governmental agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit or rescind our acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations, impose significant fines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations. Moreover, it may be costly to adjust some of our business practice in order to comply with these laws, regulations, rules, guidelines and implementations, and any incompliance or associated inquiries, investigations and other governmental actions may divert significant management time and attention and our financial resources, bring negative publicity, subject us to liabilities or administrative penalties, and materially and adversely affect our financial conditions, results of operations, and business prospects. 29 Table of Contents Our business generates and processes a large amount of data and is subject to various evolving PRC laws and regulations regarding cybersecurity and data privacy. Failure of cybersecurity and data privacy concerns could subject us to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences, and deter current and potential customers from using our services. Our business generates and processes a large quantity of data. We face risks inherent in handling and protecting a large amount of data that our business generates and processes from the significant number of housing transactions and services our platform facilitates. In particular, we face a number of challenges relating to data from transactions and other activities on our platform, including: protecting the data in and hosted on our system, including against attacks on our system by outside parties or fraudulent behavior or improper use by our employees; addressing concerns related to privacy and sharing, safety, security and other factors; and complying with applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, use, storage, transfer, disclosure and security of personal information, including any requests from regulatory and government authorities relating to these data. In general, we expect that data security and data protection compliance will receive greater attention and focus from regulators, both domestically and globally, as well as attract continued or greater public scrutiny and attention going forward, which could increase our compliance costs and subject us to heightened risks and challenges associated with data security and protection. If we are unable to manage these risks, we could become subject to penalties, including fines, suspension of business and revocation of required licenses, and our reputation and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We are subject to various cybersecurity and data privacy laws and regulations in China, including without limitation, the PRC Civil Code and the PRC Cybersecurity Law. See Item 4. Information on the CompanyB. Business OverviewRegulationRegulations Related to Internet Security and Privacy Protection. Moreover, different regulatory bodies in China, including the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the PRC, the CAC, the Ministry of Public Security, the State Administration for Market Regulation, and the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, have enforced data privacy and protections laws and regulations with various standards and applications. The various standards in enforcement of data privacy and protection laws have caused us difficulties in ensuring full compliance and increased our operating cost, as we need to spend time and resources to deal with various inspections for compliance. While we have adopted a rigorous and comprehensive policy for the collection, processing, sharing, disclosure authorization and other aspects of data use and privacy and taken necessary measures to comply with all applicable data privacy and protection laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee the effectiveness of these policies and measures undertaken by us, or by the agents, brokerage brands and stores or other business partners on our platform. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with all applicable data privacy and protection laws and regulations, or any failure or perceived failure of our business partners to do so, or any failure or perceived failure of our employees to comply with our internal control measures, may result in negative publicity and legal proceedings or regulatory actions against us, and could result in fines, revocation of licenses, suspension of operations or other legal or administrative penalties, which may in turn damage our reputation, discourage current and potential agents and customers, and subject us to fines and damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Furthermore, the PRC regulatory and enforcement regime with regard to cybersecurity and data protection is still evolving. PRC regulators have been increasingly focused on regulation in the areas of cybersecurity and data protection. The following are examples of certain recent PRC regulatory activities in this area. 30 Table of Contents Personal Information and Data Privacy On August 20, 2021, the State Council of the PRC promulgated the PRC Personal Information Protection Law, effective from November 1, 2021.This law requires, among others, that (i) the processing of personal information should have a clear and reasonable purpose which should be directly related to the processing purpose, in a method that has the least impact on personal rights and interests, and (ii) the collection of personal information should be limited to the minimum scope necessary to achieve the processing purpose to avoid the excessive collection of personal information. Entities handling personal information shall bear responsibilities for their personal information handling activities, and adopt necessary measures to safeguard the security of the personal information they handle. Otherwise, the entities handling personal information could be ordered to rectify, or suspend or terminate the provision of services, and face confiscation of illegal income, fines or other penalties. See Item 4. Information on the CompanyB. Business OverviewRegulationRegulations Related to Privacy Protection. The Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for the Platform Economy Sector published by the Anti-Monopoly Committee of the State Council of the PRC also prohibit collection of user information through coercive means by online platform operators. Data Security On June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress promulgated the PRC Data Security Law, which took effect in September 2021. The Data Security Law, among other things, provides for a security review procedure for the data activities that may affect national security. It also provides that any organization or individual within the territory of the PRC shall not provide any foreign judicial or law enforcement agencies with any data without the approval of the competent PRC government authorities. In addition, on December 28, 2021, the CAC, the NDRC, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and several other PRC governmental authorities jointly issued the Cybersecurity Review Measures, which further restate and expand the applicable scope of the cybersecurity review. Pursuant to the Cybersecurity Review Measures, critical information infrastructure operators that procure internet products and services, and network platform operators engaging in data processing activities, must be subject to the cybersecurity review if their activities affect or may affect national security. The Cybersecurity Review Measures further stipulate that network platform operators holding over one million users personal information shall apply with the Cybersecurity Review Office for a cybersecurity review before listing on a foreign stock exchange. In addition, the government authorities may initiate the cybersecurity review against the operators if the authorities believe that the network products or services or data processing activities of such operators affect or may affect national security. However, there are uncertainties as to the interpretation, application and enforcement of the Cybersecurity Review Measures and we cannot assure you how these measures will affect our operations. The PRC government authorities have discretion in interpretation and implementation of the Cybersecurity Review Measures, including cybersecurity review on certain activities of critical information infrastructure operators and other circumstances that affect or may affect national security. The exact scope of critical information infrastructure operators under the current regulatory regime remains unclear and the identification of critical information infrastructure operators is subject to specific identification rules stipulated by industry regulators and the notice from the regulators pursuant to the Regulations on Protection of Security of Critical Information Infrastructure. See Item 4. Information on the CompanyB. Business OverviewRegulationRegulations Related to Internet Security and Privacy Protection. As of the date of this annual report, no detailed rules or guidance with respect to the implementation of such regulations has been issued by any government authorities and we have not been informed as a critical information infrastructure operator by any government authorities. Therefore, it is uncertain whether we would be deemed as a critical information infrastructure operator under PRC law, or be subject to the cybersecurity review. The PRC government authorities may have discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of these laws, rules and regulations. We cannot assure you that regulators will not interpret or implement the laws or regulations in ways that negatively affect us. Our different lines of business are subject to evolving data security and protection laws and regulations regulating different businesses, such as the financial services business and internet-related business, which may lead to inconsistency and cause difficulties in compliance. In addition, it is possible that we may become subject to additional or new laws and regulations in this regard, particularly to cybersecurity and protection laws in other jurisdiction if we extend our business outside of the PRC in the future, which may result in additional expenses to us and subject us to potential liability and negative publicity. 31 Table of Contents Furthermore, on September 24, 2024, the CAC published the Measures on Network Data Security Management, which became effective on January 1, 2025. The measures provide that network data processors carrying out network data processing activities that affect or may affect national security shall undergo a national security review in accordance with relevant national regulations. In addition, network data processors processing personal information of over ten million individuals shall fulfill certain requirements for processing important data and take certain precautionary measures, such as identifying important data and conducting annual risk assessment. Furthermore, the measures allow network data processors to provide personal information overseas only if they strictly meet certain conditions. The measures also impose obligations on network platform service providers, requiring them to offer users features such as the ability to opt out of receiving targeted information and to delete tags based on their personal characteristics. However, there are still uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and implementation of the Measures on Network Data Security Management. The PRC government authorities also further enhanced the supervision and regulation of cross-border data transmission. On July 7, 2022, the CAC issued the Measures for Security Assessment of Cross-border Data Transfer, which became effective on September 1, 2022. These measures require the data processor providing data overseas to apply for the security assessment of cross-border transfer of data with the local provincial-level counterparts of the national cybersecurity authority under any of the following circumstances: (i) where the data processor intends to provide important data overseas; (ii) where a critical information infrastructure operator and a data processor who has processed personal information of more than 1,000,000 individuals intends to provide personal information overseas; (iii) where a data processor who has provided personal information of 100,000 individuals or sensitive personal information of 10,000 individuals to overseas recipients, in each case as calculated cumulatively, since January 1 of the preceding year intends to provide personal information overseas; or (iv) other circumstances where the security assessment of data cross-border transfer is required by the CAC. In addition, the data processor shall conduct a self-assessment on the risk of data cross-border transfer prior to applying for the foregoing security assessment. The data processors in violation of such measures are required to rectify such non-compliance incidents within six months of the effectiveness date thereof. On February 22, 2023, the CAC promulgated the Measures on the Standard Contract for the Outbound Cross-Border Transfer of Personal Information to regulate the cross-border transfer of personal information. The interpretation, application and enforcement of the above measures and how they will affect our business operation are subject to uncertainties. There are uncertainties with respect to how future laws and regulations will be implemented and interpreted in practice, and whether the future regulatory changes would impose additional requirements on companies like us. If future laws and regulations mandate clearance of cybersecurity review and other specific actions to be completed by China-based companies listed on a U.S. stock exchange, such as us, we face uncertainties as to whether such clearance can be timely obtained, or at all. As of the date of this annual report, we have not been involved in any formal investigations on cybersecurity review made by the CAC on such basis. However, if we are not able to comply with the cybersecurity and data privacy requirements in a timely manner, or at all, we may be subject to government enforcement actions and investigations, fines, penalties, suspension of our non-compliant operations, or removal of our app from the application stores, among other sanctions, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In general, compliance with the existing PRC laws and regulations, as well as additional laws and regulations that PRC regulatory bodies may enact in the future, related to data security and personal information protection, may be costly and result in additional expenses to us, and subject us to negative publicity, which could harm our reputation and business operations. There are also uncertainties with respect to how such laws and regulations will be implemented and interpreted in practice. As of the date of this annual report, (i) there had been no material incident of data or personal information leakage, infringement of data protection and privacy laws and regulations or investigation or other legal proceeding, pending or threatened against us initiated by competent government authorities or third parties, that will materially and adversely affect the business of us; and (ii) we have not been subject to any material fines, administrative penalties, or other sanctions by regulatory authorities in relation to the infringement of cybersecurity and data protection laws and regulations. In addition, we have maintained a comprehensive and rigorous data protection program and implemented comprehensive and strict internal policies, procedures and measures to ensure our compliance practice in data protection. We also set up an Information Security and Data Compliance Committee to establish, implement and update data protection and privacy policies, thus ensuring our compliance with data protection and privacy regulations and laws. For more details, see Item 16K. Cybersecurity. 32 Table of Contents In addition, regulatory authorities around the world have adopted or are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. These legislative and regulatory proposals, if adopted, and the uncertain interpretations and application thereof could, in addition to the possibility of fines, result in an order requiring that we change our data practices and policies, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, effective on May 25, 2018, includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Economic Area. The GDPR establishes new requirements applicable to the processing of personal data, affords new data protection rights to individuals and imposes penalties for serious data breaches. Individuals also have a right to compensation under the GDPR for financial or non-financial losses. Although we do not conduct any business in the European Economic Area, in the event that residents of the European Economic Area access our platform and input protected information, we may become subject to provisions of the GDPR. Compliance with such regulations and regulatory standards can be costly and any failure to comply with these regulations and regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks. We cannot guarantee that our monetization strategies will be successfully implemented or generate sustainable revenues and profit. Although we have a well-developed monetization model for our company-operated housing transaction business through Lianjia , our platform monetization model is evolving. Our Beike platform generates revenues from existing home transaction services by earning platform service fees from real estate brokerage firms on the platform as a percentage of the transaction commissions they earned on our platform, commissions from housing customers for transactions facilitated by our Lianjia brand or a split for commissions from other brokerage firms acting as principal agents in collaboration with our Lianjia agents to complete transactions, franchise fees from brokerage firms under our franchise brands such as Deyou , and service fees for other value-added services. We also generate revenues from new home transaction services by earning sales commissions from real estate developers for new home sales completed by us, from home renovation and furnishing services, and from home rental services. In addition, we generate revenues from a variety of other housing related services, including financial services and other newly developed businesses. We cannot assure you that we can successfully implement the existing business model to generate sustainable revenues, especially with respect to our attempts in broadening monetization with limited track records, or that we will be able to develop new monetization strategies to grow our revenues. If we fail to maintain the implementation of our existing business model or develop new monetization approaches, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues or effectively manage any associated costs. In addition, we may introduce new products and services for which we have little or no prior development or operating experience. If these new products or services fail to meet our expectations or are unable to attract or engage users, real estate agents, business partners or other platform participants, as the case may be, we may fail to diversify our revenue streams or generate sufficient revenues to justify our investments and costs, and our business and operating results may suffer as a result. We incurred net losses in the past, and we may not be able to remain profitable or increase profitability in the future. We incurred net loss of RMB1,397 million in 2022, and generated net incomes of RMB5,890 million in 2023 and RMB4,078 million (US$559 million) in 2024. We expect to continue to incur costs and operating expenses to support our anticipated future growth. Our costs and expenses may be greater than we anticipate and our investments to make our business and our technical infrastructure more efficient may not be successful. Our revenue, including revenue from home renovation and furnishing, home rental and other emerging businesses, may not be increasing to cover our costs and expenses. Therefore, we may not be able to remain profitable or increase profitability in the future. Our business is sensitive to economic conditions. A severe or prolonged downturn in the global or Chinese economy could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Our business depends substantially on the general economic conditions of China. Changes in international, regional or domestic economic conditions, rising interest rates, fiscal or political uncertainty, policy adjustments, market volatility, disruption to the global capital or credit markets, or the public perception that any of these events is likely to occur may have a negative impact on the housing related industry in the PRC, which in turn will have material and adverse effects on us. 33 Table of Contents COVID-19 had a severe and negative impact on the Chinese and the global economy from 2020 through 2022, and the global macroeconomic environment still faces numerous challenges. The growth rate of the Chinese economy has been slowing since 2010 and the Chinese population began to decline in 2022. The Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Hamas-Israel conflict and attacks on shipping in the Red Sea have heightened geopolitical tensions across the world. The impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on Ukraine food exports has contributed to increases in food prices and thus to inflation more generally. There have also been concerns about the relationship between China and other countries such as the United States, which may potentially have economic effects. The tension between these two countries may escalate, potentially disrupting cross-border commerce, capital flows, and investor sentiment, leading to increased compliance costs, operational disruptions, and constraints on our access to capital markets. Economic conditions in China are sensitive to global economic conditions, as well as changes in domestic economic and political policies and the expected or perceived overall economic growth rate in China. Any severe or prolonged slowdown in the global or Chinese economy may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, and continued turbulence in the international markets may adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs. Our customers and business partners may reduce or delay spending with us, while we may have difficulty expanding our customer base and cooperative network fast enough, or at all, or to offset the impact of decreased spending by our existing customers and business partners. We face risk in collecting our accounts receivable and deposits from real estate developers. We incur accounts receivable with, and pay earnest deposits to, real estate developers when we are engaged to sell new home projects and we grant them credit terms for our sales commissions in line with the industry practice in China. As of December 31, 2024, the balance of deposits paid to real estate developers was RMB0.5 billion (US$0.07 billion) and the accounts receivable due from them was RMB5.9 billion (US$0.8 billion). We may face risk collecting these amounts if the operation and liquidity condition of real estate developers deteriorate. Meanwhile, any policy change aiming at tightening regulations of real estate developers may limit their access to financing channels and may cause adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable. For instance, since the end of 2020, the regulators have tightened the financial requirements for real estate developers to seek new debt financings, with the aim of curing the rapid growth of debts of real estate developers. Under the rules, the growth rate of debt financing allowed for a real estate developer is contingent on its satisfaction of three debt-related financial metrics, and if it fails to meet all three metrics, it will be restricted from obtaining any new interest-bearing debt financing. We took measures in managing the collection risk, such as promoting the Commission in Advance model to encourage real estate developers to pay us in advance. However, if any of the real estate developers with significant outstanding accounts receivable and deposits were to become insolvent or otherwise become unable or refuse, to make payments in a timely manner, or at all, we would have to make additional provisions against such accounts receivable and deposits, or write off the amounts, either of which could adversely affect our financial conditions and profitability. Disruption or discontinuity in the features and functions of our infrastructure components, especially ACN, may materially and adversely affect our business. We rely on the proper functioning of ACN and the modules of our infrastructure for the daily operations of our platform. Although we have implemented a comprehensive rules and protocols in ACN, we cannot assure you that all aspects of our ACN rules will be satisfactorily implemented in each housing transaction on our platform. With the increasing number of participating real estate brokerage brands and agents who were not previously familiar with ACN rules, it may be difficult for us to effectively monitor and control these brands and agents to ensure their business performance and conducts in accordance with ACN rules. If violations of ACN rules or other inappropriate actions occur, such as circumventing our platform to facilitate transactions that are required to be partitioned according to ACN rules, and if we fail to effectively prevent non-compliance or discipline the responsible brands or agents, the effectiveness of our ACN system may be diminished and other agents on our platform may be less willing to follow the rules, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any material disruption or malfunction of other modules, such as our SaaS systems and customer front end, may also compromise the service quality of our service providers on the platform and affect our operations materially and adversely. 34 Table of Contents We cooperate with various real estate brokerage brands, stores and agents on our platform. If we are not able to develop relationships with new real estate brokerage brands and agents or maintain our relationship with existing real estate brokerage brands and agents on our platform, our operations may be materially and adversely affected. We believe the large and active network of real estate brokerage brands and their affiliated stores and agents contributes significantly to the success of our platform. As of December 31, 2024, there were approximately 49,000 community-centric active brokerage stores and over 445,000 active agents affiliated with these stores. Aside from the Lianjia brand that we own and operate, the connected brokerage brands and the sales channels we specifically procured for new home transactions contributed a substantial majority of the GTV on our platform in 2024. We enter into business cooperation agreements with brokerage brands. Under these agreements, we offer the brokerage brands access to the infrastructure on our platform, such as ACN and SaaS systems. The brokerage brands, in turn, would commit to following our ACN as well as other protocols on the platform and subscribe to an agreed-upon fee structure. It is uncertain, however, that we are able to develop relationships with new real estate brokerage brands, stores and agents in line with our plan to expand our platform business, or that we are able to maintain our relationship with existing brokerage brands, stores and agents on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, after the terms of the current cooperation agreements expire. In the event that we are not able to develop new relationships or maintain our existing relationship, our ability to serve a large number of housing customers nationwide with superior housing transactions and to maintain and develop our extensive authentic property listing inventory may be restricted, which may in turn materially and adversely affect our platform operations. If we fail to maintain our relationships with real estate developers or attract them to engage us, or otherwise fail to procure new real estate property listings at favorable terms, our business and growth prospects may suffer. We cooperate with real estate developers for new property sales on our platform and established business relationships with major real estate developers in China. Maintaining strong relationships with real estate developers is critical to the results of operations and prospects on our new home sales business. We enter into strategic cooperation agreements with real estate developers, and these agreements typically do not restrict the real estate developers from cooperating with other real estate brokerage firms. We cannot assure you that the real estate developers we currently cooperate with will continue the cooperation on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, after the terms of the current agreements expire or after our cooperative arrangements end. Our ability to attract real estate developers to engage us in selling new homes will also affect the prospects of the new home sales business. If we cannot ensure that our channels sales are superior to their traditional way of sales, or, for example, the sales channels that do not utilize ACN are unable to meet real estate developers expectations or our VR initiatives are not effective in attracting housing customers, we might not be able to attract new real estate developers or even maintain our existing relationships. Even if we maintain strong relationships with the real estate developers or are able to attract them, their ability to provide adequate new property listings at competitive prices may be adversely affected by economic conditions, regulatory environment, labor actions, regulatory or legal proceedings against them, natural disasters or other factors beyond our control. If we fail to attract new real estate developers to cooperate with us due to any reason, our business and growth prospects may be materially and adversely affected. We are subject to risks in ou r home renovation and furnishing services, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects. The success of our home renovation and furnishing services depends on our ability to perform such services in a timely manner with high quality and within cost budget. Although we offer various levels of trainings to our home renovation and furnishing service providers to perform renovation and furnishing work, we are still exposed to various risks inherent to home renovation and furnishing business. Most of our agreements for home renovation and furnishing encompass fixed and pre-agreed prices for the project. We determine the prices based on several factors, such as construction area and complexity, project duration, estimated costs (including material costs required for completing interior renovation), and contract amounts of similar projects. If our assumptions regarding the costs or timing for home renovation and furnishing prove to be materially inaccurate, our results of operations, financial condition, and prospects may be adversely affected. Actual costs incurred may be influenced by several factors beyond our control, such as (i) shortages and cost hikes in materials and labor; (ii) customer requests for design changes; (iii) disputes with customers and material suppliers; (iv) regulatory requirements, government policies, and inflations; (v) safety incidents, such as fire accidents; and (vi) adverse weather conditions and other unforeseen issues. Any significant deviations in these factors affecting costs or other adverse factors may result in project delays and cost overruns, thereby adversely impacting our performance, reputation, and financial condition. 35 Table of Contents We may experience project delays due to other unforeseen circumstances, including shortages in labor or raw material, delays in delivery of supplies, and work-related accidents. Specifically, we may not be able to fully ensure the service qualities of our suppliers or vendors. We procure various materials, such as glass, tiles, hardware, sanitary ware, wallpaper, marble, or eco-friendly wood from suppliers and engage other vendors to provide various services, including delivery and installation of home appliances, transportation, and warehousing services. We rely on these suppliers to deliver materials or provide services in a timely and reliable manner. Our suppliers are selected on market reputation, quality of services or materials, pricing, and timeliness of delivery. There is no guarantee that the materials and services provided by external suppliers will meet our quality standards, nor that they will be able or willing to continue providing materials and services to us. If products provided by these suppliers have quality issues or services provided are defective, leading to project delays or failures to complete projects, we may incur additional costs. We may also be subject to administrative penalties if the designers, suppliers, vendors, or other service providers engage in misconducts or violate law and regulations, which could lead to safety risks related to the property. If our projects are delayed due to factors beyond our control, we may be required to pay damages stipulated in our contract arrangements and incur additional costs. Typically, we are obligated to pay a certain amount of compensation for each day of delay, which could adversely affect our operations and reduce our profit margins. Additionally, we provide customers for our home renovation and furnishing services with a warranty period during which we undertake to repair any defects caused by us without charging our customers additional costs. Therefore, we may incur additional costs above the budget to rectify defects causing disputes. Furthermore, if there are craftsmanship defects, deviations from contract specifications, and/or defects in the quality of materials used or supplied in our projects, we may encounter complaints, disputes, and claims for damages. These complaints, disputes, and claims may lead to legal and other proceedings, result in significant costs, and divert our management resources and attention from business operations. If such complaints, disputes, claims, and proceedings are judicated unfavorably to us, we may be liable for damages, incur legal and other costs, or accept unfavorable settlement terms, which could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects. We face risks of workspace accidents and violations of workplace safety regulations. Although we have taken various safety measures as required by laws and regulations, accidents or other safety incidents may still occur in our ordinary course of business, such as during the delivery and installation of home renovation products and home renovation and furnishing process, or in our office premises and stores. Consequently, we may face personal injury claims due to accidents or injuries suffered by our employees and/or service providers in workspace, which could result in significant losses and delays for delivery of services. Under the PRC Labor Contract Law and other laws and regulations, we are also responsible for injuries sustained by our employees at work. We may also face fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities for violations of workplace safety regulations in our projects. In such cases, our business, results of operations, and prospects may be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, accidents or safety incidents may expose us to claims for damages from employees or other individuals injured or harmed, or even for fatalities, as well as claims under our insurance policies for related claims. If such claims for damages against us exceed the limits of our insurance coverage, our financial condition may also be adversely affected. We are subject to risks in our home rental services. As we are exploring and expanding our home rental business, we are subject to risks associated with the rental properties and our services. Our decentralized rental property management business, Carefree Rent , is an important part of our home rental services. Under the Carefree Rent model, we obtain landlord authorization to manage the properties and provide professional rental services to tenants. On the one hand, we are subject to rental property management service agreements with specified terms entered into with the landlords, during which early termination will be subject to damages for breach of contract. On the other hand, we are subject to lease agreements with specified terms entered into with the tenants and the landlords, during which early termination may result in paying damages for breach of contract. Our services for other rental properties are subject to similar risks. 36 Table of Contents We make profits on ourhome rental services mainly from the total rents collected from tenants after deducting the rents due to landlords, and/or management fees collected from the landlords and tenants. As such, the profitability of ourhome rental services largely depends on how fast we are able to lease the properties and the quality of our management services. We typically pay a small amount of deposit to the landlords under our Carefree Rent before the entrustment, which could be (a) used as damages due to the landlords if we are not able to lease the properties within a certain period or on favorable terms or (b) used to settle the rents due to the landlords if the properties are successfully leased. In addition, after we lease the properties, tenants may terminate their leases during lease terms by paying damages for breach of contract or fail to meet their obligations in connection with the leases, exposing us to the obligation of re-leasing our rental properties, and we may be unable to re-lease the properties on a timely basis, on favorable terms, or at all. Our liquidity may be materially and adversely affected by tenants early termination. Likewise, short-term leases may result in high turnover, which involves costs such as restoring the rental apartments, marketing costs and lower occupancy levels. Similarly, we may not be able to terminate the agreements with the landlords at no costs even if we are unable to lease or re-lease the properties, since such early termination could subject us to damages for breach of contract. The landlords may also terminate the rental property management service agreements early during the term of the agreements by paying damages for breach of contract, resulting in the early termination on our side for our lease agreements with the tenants, subject us to the damages for breach of contract. Moreover, while we plan to renew our existing home rental services agreements with landlords, we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew these agreements on commercially satisfactory terms, or at all. The landlords may demand higher rents than anticipated as a condition to renew the leases, or may lease their properties to our competitors if offered on more favorable terms. If we fail to renew our agreements with landlords or a significant number of our existing agreements with the landlords are not renewed on satisfactory terms upon expiration owners, our expansion in home rental services may be negatively affected. Furthermore, the tenants for our rental properties may engage in illegal or improper activities that are difficult for us to detect or supervise. For example, they may use our properties for illegal purposes or engage in unlawful activities on our properties, damage or make unauthorized structural changes to our property, refuse to vacate the properties upon default or termination of the leases, harass neighbors with noise or garbage, create odors or nuisances, sublet our properties in violation of the leases, or allow unauthorized individuals to reside in our properties. Although we have the right to terminate the leases in such cases, and the tenants are responsible for damages caused by their misconduct to us or other tenants, it may still result in a negative impact on our business and reputation. Damage to our properties may result in delays in re-renting, expensive repair costs, or loss of rental income, leading to lower-than-expected returns. As a result of these risks, we may not be able to make profits on ourhome rentalbusiness, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted. If we fail to obtain or keep licenses, permits or approvals applicable to the various services provided by us, we may incur significant financial penalties and other government sanctions. The real estate brokerage business in China is highly regulated by the PRC government. See also Item 4. Information on the CompanyB. Business OverviewRegulationRegulations Related to Real Estate Brokerage Business and Real Estate Agency Enterprises. Pursuant to the Real Estate Brokerage Administrative Measures, to qualify as a real estate brokerage institution, an entity and its branches should have a sufficient number of qualified real estate brokers and file with local real estate administrative authority within 30 days after obtaining its business license. We should also file with local home rental administrative authority for our home rental entities and their branches pursuant to relevant regulations. The requirements of the local real estate and home rental administrative authorities for such filings may vary among cities and we cannot assure you that, to the extent that the filing is required by local authorities, we will be able to complete the filing in a timely manner, or at all. As of the date of this annual report, all of our subsidiaries and their branches operating real estate brokerage business and home rental business have currently filed with the authorities, except that a small subset of branches which are preparing for or in the process of completing such requirements. Thus far, the filing status of these branches has not caused any material adverse effect to our business operations. We cannot assure you that the outstanding filings and future filings will be completed in a timely manner, or at all. If not, we may be subject to penalties or other governmental sanctions for such failures. 37 Table of Contents In connection with the online operations of our platform, the VIEs or their subsidiaries are also required to obtain, and have obtained, value-added telecommunications service licenses in order to provide value-added telecommunication services. In addition, to enhance the experience of our customers, agents or other business partners on our platform, we offer various auxiliary functions and complementary services through our platform and have obtained licenses and permits for these services, such as the license for non-financial institution payment service, approval for establishment of micro credit company, license for financing guarantee business, license for insurance brokerage business and approval for commercial factoring business. Given that these laws and regulations are subject to ongoing interpretation and the application in practice by government authorities and may change over time as new guidance becomes available, we may be required to obtain additional licenses, permits, filings or approvals for these functions and services. We cannot assure you that if we are required to obtain these additional licenses, permits or approvals, we will be able to do so in a timely manner, if at all, and any non-compliance may result in fines or other penalties being imposed to us. Our home renovation and furnishing business is subject to strict supervision and approval procedures under the PRC laws. For some construction projects with an investment amount or a construction area more than certain criteria, we are required to obtain regulatory approvals from various PRC government authorities, such as project approvals and filings, construction commencement permit, fire protection approvals and completion acceptance inspection. Failure to complete such filings or obtain such approvals and permits for a construction project in a timely manner may subject us to fines, suspension of construction or being prohibited from using such constructions, or rectification within a time limit. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all requisite approvals for such construction projects on a timely basis. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business operations. Our Beihaojia business is subject to extensive government regulations. In the process of promoting C2M (Customer to Manufacturer) product solutions, we have and may continue to cooperate with real estate developers to acquire land and carry out subsequent development and operations. We also have and may continue to independently acquire land and manage the projects by ourselves, verifying the competitive advantages of C2M product solutions. During this process, we must comply with a wide range of requirements set forth by national and local laws and regulations. For instance, we are required to obtain various permits, licenses, certificates and approvals from relevant PRC government authorities at different stages of a project. These include, among others, land use rights certificates, construction land planning permits, construction planning permits, construction works commencement permits, pre-sale permits and certificates of completion. Each of these approvals is subject to the fulfillment of specific conditions. We cannot assure you that we will not encounter significant delays or other impediments in meeting the conditions required to obtain these approvals. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adapt to any new laws, regulations or policies that may be introduced from time to time, whether in relation to the real estate industry in general or the specific procedures for obtaining approvals. Moreover, there may be delays in the review and approval process by government authorities. If we fail to obtain, or encounter substantial delays in obtaining the requisite governmental approvals, the development of our projects could be disrupted or delayed, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, and financial condition. Furthermore, as some of our businesses or services are innovative, we cannot assure you that the authorities share the same view as ours on the identification or category of these businesses or services in the regime of foreign investment laws, including whether appropriate licenses or permits for them have been duly applied or obtained. If we enter into new service categories and businesses, or any of our current businesses or services are determined to be subject to new licensing or similar requirements in the future, especially due to the evolving application or interpretation of laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain licenses or permits that we do not currently have, to upgrade the licenses or permits we currently have, or to satisfy other requirements arising from the government authorities. We will strive to obtain and upgrade the licenses and permits and satisfy all such requirements, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain or upgrade such licenses and permits and complete administrative procedures in a timely manner, or at all. Under applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations, the failure to obtain and/or maintain the licenses and permits required to conduct our business may subject us to various penalties, including confiscation of revenues, imposition of fines and/or restrictions on their business operations, or the discontinuation of their operations. Any such disruption in the business operations of our PRC subsidiaries or the VIEs could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 38 Table of Contents The proper functioning of technologies deployed by our platform is essential to our business. Any failure to maintain the satisfactory performance of our websites, mobile apps and systems could materially and adversely affect our business and reputation. The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our platform, both online and offline, are critical to our success and our ability to attract and retain customers and real estate agents. Any system interruptions caused by telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hacking or other attempts to harm our systems that result in the unavailability or slowdown of our online operations could reduce the transaction volumes and hamper transaction efficiency, and our platform as a whole will suffer. Our servers may also be vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, which could lead to system interruptions, website and mobile app slowdown or unavailability, delays or errors in transaction processing, loss of data or the inability to accept and fulfill customer requests. Security breaches, computer viruses and hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry. Because of our brand recognition in the housing transactions and services industry in China, we believe we are a relatively attractive target for such attacks. We have experienced in the past such unexpected interruptions, and we have taken protective measures to enhance the security of our platform. We can provide no assurance that our current security mechanisms will be sufficient to protect our IT systems from any external intrusions, viruses or hacker attacks, information or data theft or other similar activities. Any such future occurrences could reduce customer satisfaction, damage our reputation and result in a material decrease in our revenues. If hostile hacking attacks result in revelation of personal data we are obligated to protect, we may be subject to administrative penalties or legal proceedings against us. If such attacks lead to leaked trade secrets, including our property listings, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. If we are unable to recruit, train and retain competent real estate personnel or sufficient workforce while controlling our labor costs, our business may be materially and adversely affected. We will continue to recruit real estate personnel to support business operations and planned business growth. Our future success depends, to a significant extent, on our ability to recruit, train and retain competent personnel, particularly technical, marketing and other operational personnel with experience in the housing transactions and services industry as well as service providers for various value-added services on our platform. For the Lianjia brand we own and operate, we also strive to recruit, train and retain real estate agents. The effective operation of our managerial and operating systems also depends on the quality performance and diligence of our management and employees. Since our industry is characterized by high demand and intense competition for talent and labor as well as high turn-over rate, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain staff, agents and managerial talents or other highly skilled employees that we will need to achieve our strategic objectives. Labor costs in mainland China and elsewhere have increased with the global economic development. In addition, our ability to train and integrate new employees into our operations may also be limited and may not meet the demand for our business growth in a timely fashion, or at all, and rapid expansion may impair our ability to maintain our corporate culture. If we are unable to meet our demand for workforce, our business may be materially and adversely affected. We rely on our employees, real estate brokerage brands and their affiliated agents, real estate developers, financial institutions, and other business partners on our platform to provide quality services to customers. Their illegal actions or misconduct, or any failure by them to provide satisfactory services or maintain their service levels, could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. Real estate agents and certain personnel on our platform are the ultimate providers of the services offered on our platform, and our brands and reputation may be harmed by their actions that are outside our control. We rely on our employees, including Lianjia agents, supporting staff and platform operation staff to provide housing transactions and services. Notwithstanding the strictly enforced service protocols, our employees, especially our agents, may not fully comply with our protocols and laws or regulations, and may engage in misconduct or illegal actions, which may result in negative publicity and adversely impact our reputation and brand image. 39 Table of Contents We rely upon connected agents to serve some of our housing customers. Although we have established comprehensive service protocols for agents on our platform and maintain rigorous governance mechanisms, we may not be able to exercise the same level of control over the conduct of connected brokerage brands and their agents as we would as if we owned them or they were our employees. In the event of any unsatisfactory performance, lack of certain qualifications or licenses, misconduct, inappropriate service performances for illegal purpose, inappropriate remarks on we-media platforms, or other illegal actions, such as dishonesty, personal torts or extortion, by connected real estate brokerage brands and their agents, the disputes resulted from such actions may involve us and we may suffer reputational and financial damage and incur liabilities and even administrative penalties. For example, if connected agents provide inaccurate information to housing customers on our platform, who submit complaints to regulatory agencies, we may be involved as a related party in such disputes. If connected agents engage in embezzlement of housing customers transaction fund and become subject to liabilities and/or legal proceedings, we could be involved in negative publicity. Misconduct by real estate agents is subject to an increasing level of scrutiny by the regulatory authorities who would publicize such misconduct, which could damage our overall reputation, disrupt our ability to attract new customers or retain our current customers and diminish the value of our brand. Although we hold a deposit from each real estate brokerage store on our platform to cover potential financial damage, to the extent that the amount of financial damage incurred in such disputes exceeds the amount of deposit, our financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. In addition to the services provided by real estate agents on our platform, we also rely on a large number of business partners on our platform and ecosystem, such as real estate developers to provide quality services related to new home transactions, financial institutions to provide effective and affordable financial solutions to housing customers, and home renovation and furnishing service providers to provide quality materials and services that meet our standards at acceptable prices. To the extent they are unable to provide satisfactory services to housing customers and real estate agents, or they engage in any inappropriate or illegal actions, which may be due to factors that are beyond our control, we may suffer actual or reputational damage as a result. In particular, the real estate developers we cooperate with may breach the contracts with housing customers or violate laws and regulations, which may expose us to potential legal liabilities and subject us to housing customers claims for indemnifications and other remedies. Any of the failure to provide satisfactory services, potential misconduct or illegal actions discussed above could materially and adversely impact our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. Strategic alliances, investments or acquisitions may have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. We have in the past and may continue to invest in or acquire assets, technologies and businesses that are complementary to our existing business, such as our investments in other national real estate brokerage companies, our strategic acquisitions of real estate brokerage brands and Shengdu in the past and our investments in acquisition of properties for development in our Beihaojia business. Our investments or acquisitions may involve significant risks and may not yield the results we expect. Challenges and risks associated with strategic alliances, investments or acquisitions include: Investments and acquisitions and subsequent investments (if any) could result in the use of substantial amounts of cash, and potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. For instance, we acquired Shengdu for an aggregate consideration of RMB3.92 billion in cash and 44,315,854 of our Class A ordinary shares in equity, and the issuance of new securities had a dilutive effect on our existing shareholders. In addition, investments and acquisitions could involve, significant amortization expenses related to goodwill or intangible assets and exposure to potential unknown liabilities of the acquired business. For example, our investments in property acquisitions for our Beihaojia business may not yield the anticipated returns, or any returns at all. This could lead to the recognition of significant impairment charges, adversely affecting our financial results. If such goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant decrease to our results of operations; Investments and acquisitions may require our management team to devote a significant amount of attention in implementation or remediation of controls, procedures and policies at the invested or acquired companies; The cost of identifying and consummating investments and acquisitions and integrating the acquired businesses into ours may be significant, and the integration of acquired businesses may be difficult or become disruptive to our existing business operations; We may also have to obtain approval from the PRC governmental authorities or complete certain administrative procedures for the investments and acquisitions and comply with any applicable PRC rules and regulations, which may be costly; 40 Table of Contents Actual or alleged misconduct or non-compliance by any company we acquire or invest in (or by its affiliates) that occurred may lead to negative publicity, government inquiry or investigations against such company or against us; Investments and acquisitions may raise regulatory concerns in relation to the anti-monopoly and competition laws, rules and regulations of China, which could affect the consummation of the transaction; Unexpected situations in the area where we conduct investments or acquisitions, such as local protectionism, may impede the closing of our investments or acquisitions and the proper functioning of the invested business; O ur financial conditions and results of operations may be adversely affected as we provide loans to some of the companies we invest in and we may be unable to retrieve the loans if the invested companies do not perform well; In the case of foreign acquisitions, we face difficulties and risks in addressing the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to deal with the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and We may fail to retain and integrate qualified employees of the invested or acquired companies. In the event that our investments and acquisitions are not successful, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position, and external infringements of our intellectual property rights may adversely affect our business. Our success and ability to compete depends in part on our intellectual property. We primarily rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions with our employees, contractors and others to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. However, confidentiality and license arrangements may be breached by counterparties, and there may not be adequate remedies available to us for any such breach. Accordingly, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights or to enforce our contractual rights. In addition, our trade secrets may be leaked or otherwise become available to, or be independently discovered by, our competitors. The steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate or we may be unable to secure intellectual property protection for some of our properties. Infringement of intellectual property rights continues to pose a serious risk of doing business. We have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications on certain of our innovations. It is possible, however, that these innovations may not be patentable. In addition, given the cost, effort and risks associated with patent application, we may choose not to seek patent protection for some innovations. Furthermore, our patent applications may not lead to granted patents, the scope of the protection gained may be insufficient or an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable. In addition, we have filed, and may continue to file, applications on certain of our trademarks, which may not always be approved on a timely basis, or at all. We also cannot guarantee that any of our present or future patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, or abandoned. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our competitors could use our intellectual property to market offerings similar to ours and our ability to compete effectively would be impaired. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe on our intellectual property. The enforcement of our intellectual property rights depends on our legal actions against these infringers being successful, but we cannot be sure these actions will be successful, even when our rights have been infringed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense and diversion of management resources. Any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative processes or litigations. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in such litigations, and, even if we do prevail, we may not obtain a meaningful relief. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent external parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property. Any intellectual property that we own may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by external parties. 41 Table of Contents We have been and may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims or other allegations, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects. We cannot be certain that our services and information provided on our website, operating and technology systems, Weixin Mini Programs and public accounts and mobile apps do not or will not infringe patents, copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights held by external parties. From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims alleging infringement of patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights, or misappropriation of creative ideas or formats, or other infringement of proprietary intellectual property rights. In addition, we allow our agents on the platform to upload listings to our mobile apps and websites, which may include images or other detailed information of houses. However, a small portion of such content posted on our mobile apps and websites may expose us to allegations by third parties regarding, among other things, infringement of intellectual property rights, unfair competition, invasion of privacy, defamation and other violations of third-party rights. Our failure to identify unauthorized content posted on our mobile apps and websites may subject us to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or other rights, defending of which may impose a significant burden on our management and employees, and there can be no assurance that we will obtain final outcomes that are favorable to us. The validity, enforceability and scope of intellectual property rights protection in internet-related industries, particularly in China, are still evolving. For example, as we face increasing competition and as litigation is more frequently used to resolve disputes in China, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims. Pursuant to laws and regulations, internet service providers may be held liable for damages if such providers have reason to know that content infringes the copyrights of others. In cases involving the unauthorized posting of copyrighted content by users on websites in China, there have been court proceedings but no specific official interpretation or guidance as to when and how hosting providers and administrators of websites can be held liable for the unauthorized posting by external parties of copyrighted material. Any such proceeding could result in significant costs to us and divert our managements time and attention from the operation of our business, as well as potentially adversely impact our reputation, even if we are ultimately absolved of all liability. We face competition from other industry players. We may lose market share and customers if we fail to compete effectively. The housing related industry in China is rapidly evolving and increasingly competitive. Although we believe no other industry player in China operates under the integrated platform business model similar to ours, we face competition from players in different segments of the housing transactions and services industry. We face competition with other online platform for housing transactions, property listings or traffic, and our housing database might be exposed to fierce competition. We may also face intense competition from other housing transaction companies for their agent networks. For our new home sales business, we also compete with other new home sales channels. In addition to these platforms and companies at the national level, we compete with offline traditional real estate brokerage stores and brands for real estate agents and housing customers locally. We also compete with other companies for housing related services, such as other providers of home renovation and furnishing services and home rental services. Increasing competition in the housing transactions and services industry would lead to declining market share and commission rate, make it more difficult for us to retain and attract real estate brokerage brands and agents, business partners and customers, or force us to increase irrational sales and marketing expenses, any of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, and competitive pressures may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The businesses of Ziroom Inc., its subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities, or collectively, Ziroom, one of our related parties, involve, among other things, the leasing solutions and property-related services offered to property owners with respect to dispersed and centralized assets. Those businesses of Ziroom may potentially compete with our home rental services, including Carefree Rent , which were developed at scale by us during the second half of 2022. However, in view of a number of factors, including, among other things, the differences in target customer clusters, rental products and principal business focuses between the businesses operated by Ziroom and us, as well as the corporate governance measures put in place by us, including the fiduciary duties of a director, the separate and independent management teams over the relevant businesses and measures adopted to resolve situations where a director may have a conflict of interest, we are of the view that there is no material competition between the businesses operated Ziroom and us. However, we cannot assure you that the competition between Ziroom and us will not become more intense. If such competition becomes more intense in the future, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted. 42 Table of Contents If other companies copy property listings from our mobile apps and websites and publish or aggregate them for their own benefit, attractiveness of our platform may decline. There is no assurance that other companies would not copy property listings or other information from our mobile apps, websites and Weixin Mini Programs, through website scraping, robots or other means, and publish or aggregate it with other information for their own benefit. When external parties engage in such conducts, housing customers may be misguided and driven away from our platform and complete their transactions somewhere else, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. We may fail to detect such anti-competitive conduct in a timely manner and, even if we could, we may find it costly to be fixed or not be able to prohibit it. Tencent provides services to us in connection with various aspects of our operations. If such services become limited, restricted, curtailed, less effective or more expensive or become unavailable to us for any reason, our business may be materially and adversely affected. We collaborate with Tencent, one of our principal shareholders and a leading internet service provider in China that provides communication and social, digital content, online advertising, fintech, cloud and other business services. We entered into a cloud services and technical services framework agreement with Tencent, pursuant to which Tencent agreed to provide us with certain cloud and technical services. If services provided by Tencent to us become limited, compromised, restricted, curtailed, less effective, more expensive, or unavailable to us for any reason, including the availability of our Weixin Mini Programs, customer access to our platform via Weixin and the provision of cloud and other business services, our business may be materially and adversely affected. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from Chinas major cities, in particular, Beijing and Shanghai, and we face market risk due to our concentration in these major urban areas. Beijing and Shanghai are the two largest housing related markets in China. In 2022, 2023 and 2024, 31.9%, 32.3% and 35.6%, respectively, of our net revenues were generated from these two markets on a combined basis. We expect these two urban centers to continue to be the important sources of revenues in all of our revenue categories. If we fail to maintain our competitive positions in either of the two major urban areas, or if either of them encounters events which negatively impact the housing related industry or online platform business, such as a serious economic downturn or contraction, a natural disaster, or a decline in housing price or price control due to governmental policies or otherwise, demand for our products and services could significantly decline and our net revenues and profitability could be materially and adversely impacted. Any unexpected material deterioration in the business and financial results of Lianjia may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Being the brand that we own and operate directly, Lianjia is also the leading real estate brokerage brand in respect of service quality on our platform in terms of revenue. Thus far, Lianjia has accounted for a significant portion of our revenue. Accordingly, our revenues, financial condition or results of operations may be materially affected by fluctuations in the business of Lianjia . If Lianjia fails to continue to efficiently serve the needs of our housing customers and if other brands on our platform are unable to compensate the gap, or if any unexpected deterioration of the business and financial results of Lianjia occurs, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects will be materially and adversely affected. 43 Table of Contents We have granted and expect to continue to grant share-based awards in the future under our share incentive plans, which may result in increased share-based compensation expenses. We adopted (i) a Pre-IPO Share Option Scheme in 2018, or the 2018 Share Option Plan, (ii) a 2020 Global Share Incentive Plan, as amended in April 2022 and effective in May 2022, or the 2020 Share Incentive Plan, and (iii) a 2022 Global Share Incentive Plan, or the 2022 Share Incentive Plan, to provide additional incentives to employees, directors and consultants. The maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares which may be issued under the 2018 Share Option Plan is 350,225,435. No options were or will be granted pursuant to the 2018 Share Option Plan after our Hong Kong Listing in May 2022. The maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares which may be issued under the 2020 Share Incentive Plan is amended to 253,246,913 upon our Hong Kong Listing, excluding a total of 43,407,213 restricted share units representing the same number of Class A ordinary shares granted before. The maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares which may be issued under the 2022 Share Incentive Plan is 125,692,439, all of which were granted in the form of restricted shares. See Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and EmployeesB. CompensationShare Incentive Plans. We have granted share-based awards and recorded RMB2,425 million, RMB3,216 million and RMB2,726 million (US$373 million) in 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively, in share-based compensation expenses in relation to such share-based award grants. We also expect to continue to grant awards under our share incentive plans, which we believe is of significant importance to our ability to attract and retain key personnel and employees. As a result, our expenses associated with share-based compensation may increase, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We have in the past been subject to legal and regulatory proceedings and administrative investigations and may continue to be subject to these proceedings and investigations from time to time. If the outcome of these proceedings or investigations is adverse to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. We have been, and may from time to time in the future be, subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. Claims and complaints arising out of actual or alleged violations of laws and regulations could be asserted against us by real estate developers and other business partners, agents, customers, our competitors, or governmental entities in administrative, civil or criminal investigations and proceedings or by other entities. As we entered into contractual relationship with various real estate developers, brokerage brands and stores and customers, we have been and may be involved in disputes and legal or administrative proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. We may also be involved and assume joint liability when we provide services to business partners on our platform who are named as defendants by customers due to various reasons including contract violations, lack of licenses or qualifications, lack of cash liquidity and bankruptcy of such business partners. We have been and may continue to be subject to formal and informal inquiries, investigations and inspections from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and regulations, many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation by local regulatory authorities. Most of these administrative actions may be routine in nature and carried out as part of the market monitoring and supervision functions of the regulatory authorities, but some of them may be triggered by our industry position in housing transactions and services industry or by complaints from third parties or customers. Especially, our industry position in housing transactions and services industry and our approach to expand our businesses through an online platform may draw heightened scrutiny from the regulatory authorities or cause to be paid close attention to our business operation. The above-mentioned inquiries, inspections, investigations, claims and complaints can be initiated or asserted under or on the basis of a variety of laws and regulations in different jurisdictions, including real estate laws, advertising laws, home rental laws, value-added telecommunication services laws, home renovation service-related laws, real estate development laws, intellectual property laws, unfair competition laws, anti-monopoly laws, data protection and privacy laws, labor and employment laws, securities laws, cybersecurity laws, finance services laws, work safety laws, fire protection laws, tort laws, contract laws, property laws and customer protection laws. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves in legal and administrative actions or in asserting our rights under various laws. If we fail to defend ourselves in these actions, we may be subject to restrictions, fines or penalties that will materially and adversely affect our operations. Even if we are successful in our attempt to defend ourselves in legal and regulatory actions or to assert our rights under various laws and regulations, the process of communicating with regulators, defending ourselves and enforcing our rights against the various parties involved may be expensive, time-consuming and ultimately futile. These actions could expose us to negative publicity, substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs, injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties, including but not limited to suspension or revocation of licenses to conduct business. 44 Table of Contents We are subject to the F oreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws, trade sanction laws and export control laws, violation of which could adversely affect our reputation, business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. We are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States, including exposure to complex foreign and U.S. regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws which generally prohibit companies listed in the U.S., their employees, and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and which generally require companies to keep accurate books and records in reasonable detail. Violations of this act and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions and other penalties. It may be difficult to fully control and oversee the conduct of contractors, business partners, representatives, third-party agents or our employees, including real estate agents on our platform, potentially exposing us to greater risk from their actions. If the aforesaid individuals or entities fail to comply with applicable laws or company policies governing our operations, we or our employees may face legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administration actions and criminal sanctions. Any determination or publication that we or our employees have violated any anti-corruption laws or that our books and records are not sufficiently detailed or accurate could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition. In addition, any changes in trade sanctions laws or export control laws may also restrict our business practices. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in significant fines, civil, criminal or administrative sanctions against us, our directors and officers or our employees, requirements to obtain export licenses, disgorgement of profits, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and our inability to market our services. Any changes to or violations of such laws could materially damage our reputation, brand, expansion efforts, ability to attract and retain customers and agents as well as our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. We may not be able to maintain our culture, which has been a key to our success. Our culture, implicated in our grand vision and mission, is important to us, and we believe it has been critical to our success. We may have difficulties maintaining our culture or adapting it sufficiently to meet the needs of our future and evolving operations as we continue to grow, in particular as we have become a public company with the attendant changes in policies, practices, corporate governance and management requirements. Failure to maintain our culture could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Our expansion into new service and product categories and businesses may expose us to new challenges and more risks. Although we have been successful in expanding into new service and product categories and businesses, such as establishing our platform business, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue our success in our expansion into new service and product categories and businesses in the future. For example, we are cooperating with more real estate developers for new home sales on our platform and we are expanding into adjacent opportunities such as home renovation and furnishing. Meanwhile, we are leveraging our technological capabilities to offer functions such as VR property showing. In recent years, we launched our home renovation and furnishing services through Beiwoo in 2020 and expanded such services through acquisition of Shengdu which closed in 2022. We also launched our home rental services including our decentralized home rental services, Carefree Rent . In 2023, we have upgraded our corporate strategy to One Body, Three Wings to add Beihaojia business, which focuses on upgrading new homes, as a third wing. The business model of Beihaojia is at an early stage and subject to changes. Our lack of experience with these new service and product categories may adversely affect our prospects and our ability to compete with the existing market players in any of these service and product categories. Moreover, the expansion into new businesses may disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees and increase our expenses to cover unforeseen or hidden liabilities or costs. We may also face challenges in achieving the expected benefits of synergies and growth opportunities in connection with these new service categories and businesses. Besides, we may be subject to additional compliance requirements for these new service and product categories and businesses. Failure to expand successfully may also diminish investor confidence in our decision-making and execution capabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Our Beihaojia business is subject to various risks . Beihaojia primarily provides C2M product solutions for real estate developers and other business partners, leveraging Beikes vast data accumulation and Beikes capability to connect potential customers, which is a relatively innovative business model that may not be well perceived by the customers or real estate developers and other business partners. If the market acceptance of the C2M product solutions is not as well as expected, the expansion of our Beihaojia business may be restrained and may not justify the cost of operating the business. Consequently, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 45 Table of Contents In addition to the risks associated with the market acceptance of the Beihaojia business and associated with the housing related industry, we are subject to risks relating to real estate development. In the process of promoting C2M product solutions, we have and may continue to cooperate with real estate developers to acquire land and carry out subsequent development and operations. We also have and may continue to independently acquire land and manage the projects by ourselves, verifying the competitive advantages of C2M product solutions in the stages of land acquisition, product positioning and design, development and construction, and sales. Beihaojia s operating performance may fluctuate due to factors such as the progress of property projects developed by us or in cooperation with our business partners, whether the properties are welcomed by target customers, and the rise and fall of land costs and construction expenses. If we or our business partners are unable to acquire suitable land for future development or redevelopment in a timely manner or on favorable terms, develop and operate the acquired land according to the expected project schedule at reasonable costs, or sell the developed properties at satisfactory prices or terms to generate reasonable economic returns, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected. We record the property inventories related to the Beihaojia business at cost. If the market environment deteriorates, the sales of the properties we develop slow down, or prices decline, the business may face impairment risks, adversely affecting our operating results. Although currently we do not heavily rely on financing for our Beihaojia business, if we require additional financing for future land acquisitions and development, there can be no assurance that such additional financing, either on a short-term or a long-term basis, will be made available or, if available, that such financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us. If our expansion into new geographical areas is not successful, our business and prospects may be materially and adversely affected. We have a track record of successfully expanding into new geographical areas. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to maintain this momentum in the future. As the conditions of the housing markets in any new local markets may vary significantly from where we currently operate our platform, expansion into new geographical areas involves new risks and challenges. Our lack of familiarity with, and housing data relating to, these geographical areas may make it more difficult for us to keep pace with the evolving market conditions. In addition, there may be one or more existing market leaders in any geographical area that we decide to expand into. If we fail to cooperate with them, such companies may be able to compete more effectively than us by leveraging their experience in doing business in that market as well as their familiarity with the local customers. Regulatory uncertainties related to financial services in China could harm our business, financial condition and results of operation. Our financial services may be subject to a variety of PRC laws and regulations governing financial services. The application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are evolving and are subject to the discretion of government authorities. In particular, the PRC governments regulatory framework governing the new and evolving online finance market and its ancillary services, which concerns the transactions that our platform facilitates between our customers and external financial institutions, the cooperation between us and financial institutions and other housing related financial services we provide, is evolving and is subject to further change, interpretation and implementation of local enforcement practice at this stage. See Item 4. Information on the CompanyB. Business OverviewRegulationRegulations Related to Financing. For example, pursuant to the Circular on the Issuance of the Supplementary Provisions on Supervision and Administration of Financing Guarantee Companies, which was issued in October 2019 and amended in June 2021, to clarify that residential real estate guarantee companies shall be regulated under the financing guarantee regulations and shall acquire a financing guarantee business license before June 2020. See Item 4. Information on the CompanyB. Business OverviewRegulationRegulations Related to FinancingRegulations Related to Financing Guarantee. As we offer guarantee services through guarantee companies, we are subject to this circular and other regulations related to financing guarantee companies. Beijing Zhongrongxin Financing Guarantee Limited Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Yiju Taihe, and Shenzhen Beike Financing Guarantee Limited Co., Ltd., one of our PRC subsidiaries, have obtained the license for financing guarantee business. However, as the interpretation and implementation of laws and regulations on financing guarantee are uncertain and still evolving, we cannot assure you that our financing guarantee business do not and will not violate laws and regulations in China. 46 Table of Contents As of the date of this annual report, we have not been subject to any material fines or other penalties under any PRC laws or regulations on our financial services. The PRC government may adopt new laws and regulations for the online and mobile or even offline finance market in the future and impose specific requirements (including licensing requirements) on market participants, or enhance the implementation of existing laws and regulations. If our financial services or practice are deemed to have violated any existing or future laws and regulations, we may face injunctions, including orders to rectify or cease activities, and may be subject to other penalties as determined by the government authorities. Furthermore, we may be ordered to adjust our finance services to meet the new requirements under the laws, rules and regulations, which may require considerable resources and time, and could significantly affect the operation of our business. If we fail to adopt new technologies or adapt our mobile apps, websites and systems to changing user requirements or emerging industry standards, our business may be materially and adversely affected. We must continue to enhance and improve the functionality, effectiveness and features of our websites, mobile apps and Weixin Mini Programs. The internet and online mobile application industry are characterized by rapid technological evolution, changes in customer requirements and preferences, frequent introductions of new products and services embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices, any of which could render our existing technologies and systems obsolete. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to identify, develop, acquire or license technologies useful in our business, and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices in a cost-effective and timely way. In recent years, we invested in the development of many new technologies and business initiatives, such as virtual reality, Smart Hardware and Internet-of-Things and big data. The development of websites, mobile apps and other proprietary technologies entails significant technical and business risks. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop or effectively use new technologies, recoup the costs of developing new technologies or adapt our websites, mobile apps, proprietary technologies and systems to meet customer requirements or emerging industry standards. If we are unable to adapt in a cost-effective and timely manner in response to changing market conditions or user preferences, whether for technical, legal, financial or other reasons, our business may be materially and adversely affected. Some of our products and services contain open-source software, which may pose a particular risk to our proprietary software, products and services in a manner that negatively affects our business. We use open-source software in our software and systems and will use open-source software in the future. The licenses applicable to our use of open-source software may require the source code that is developed using open-source software be made available to the public and that any modifications or derivative works to certain open-source software continue to be licensed under open-source licenses. From time to time, we may face claims from external parties claiming infringement of their intellectual property rights, or demanding the release or license of the open-source software or derivative works that we developed using such software (which could include our proprietary source code) or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open-source license. Our use of open-source software may also present additional security risks because the source code for open-source software is publicly available, which may make it easier for hackers and other parties to determine how to breach our website and systems that rely on open-source software. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. If major mobile application distribution channels change their standard terms and conditions in a manner that is detrimental to us, or suspend or terminate their existing relationship with us, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. We currently cooperate with Apples app store and major Android app stores to distribute our mobile applications to users. As such, the promotion, distribution and operation of our applications are subject to such distribution platforms standard terms and policies for application developers, which are subject to the interpretation of, and frequent changes by, these distribution channels. If these third-party distribution platforms change their terms and conditions in a manner that is detrimental to us, or refuse to distribute our applications, or if any other major distribution channel with which we would like to seek collaboration refuses to collaborate with us in the future on commercially favorable terms, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 47 Table of Contents Our business depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our directors, executive officers and other key persons. If we lose their services, our business operations and growth prospects may be materially and adversely affected. Our future success depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our directors, executive officers and key persons. In particular, we rely on the leadership, expertise, experience and vision of our directors and senior management team. If one or more of our directors, executive officers or other key persons were unable or unwilling to continue their services with us, whether due to resignation, accident, health condition, family considerations or any other reason, we might not be able to find their successors, in a timely manner, or at all. Since the housing transactions and services industry is characterized by high demand and intense competition for talent, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain qualified management or other highly skilled employees. We do not have key man insurance for our directors, executive officers or other key persons. If any of our key persons terminate his or her services or otherwise becomes unable to provide continuous services to us, our business may be severely and adversely affected, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we may incur additional expenses to recruit, train and retain qualified personnel. Each of our executive officers and key employees has entered into an employment agreement with a non-compete clause with us. However, these agreements may be breached by the counterparties, and there may not be adequate and timely remedies available to us to compensate our losses arising from the breach. We cannot assure you that we would be able to enforce these non-compete clauses. If any of our executive officers or key persons joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose customers, know-hows and key professionals and staff members. Pandemics and epidemics, natural disasters, terrorist activities, political unrest and other outbreaks could disrupt our production, delivery, and operations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Global pandemics, epidemics, or fear of the spread of contagious diseases, such as COVID-19, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), Ebola virus disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1 flu, H7N9 flu and avian flu, as well as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, or other natural disasters could disrupt our business operations, reduce or restrict the ability of real estate agents, home renovation workers and other service providers to provide services, or incur significant costs to protect our employees and facilities. Actual or threatened wars, terrorist activities, political unrests, civil strife and other geopolitical uncertainty could have a similar adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We rely on certain key operating metrics to evaluate the performance of our business, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business. We rely on certain key operating metrics, such as GTV, the number of active real estate brokerage stores and agents on our platform, among other things, to evaluate the performance of our business. Our operating metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics used by other companies due to differences in methodology and assumptions. We calculate these operating metrics using internal company data. There are inherent challenges in measuring such key metrics and company data, and measurement of such metrics and data may be susceptible to delays and technical errors. If we discover material inaccuracies in the operating metrics we use, or if they are perceived to be inaccurate, our reputation may be harmed and our evaluation methods and results may be impaired, which could negatively affect our business. If investors make investment decisions based on operating metrics we disclose that are inaccurate, we may also face potential lawsuits or disputes. We have limited insurance coverage, which could expose us to significant costs and business disruption. We maintain various insurance policies to safeguard against risks and unexpected events. However, we do not maintain business interruption insurance or key-man insurance. We cannot assure you that our insurance coverage is sufficient to prevent us from any loss or that we will be able to successfully claim our losses under our current insurance policy on a timely basis, or at all. If we incur any loss that is not covered by our insurance policies, or the compensated amount is significantly less than our actual loss, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 48 Table of Contents Our results of operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations. Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, normally with relatively weaker performance in the first quarter, consistent with the housing related industry in general. Subject to any other macroeconomic or regulatory conditions, the first quarter of each calendar year generally contributes the smallest portion of our annual revenue, primarily due to a reduced number of housing transactions and rental activities during the Chinese New Year holiday period and reduced home renovation and furnishing works in winter. We may face new factors that may increase the seasonality fluctuation in the future. As a result, our results of operations and the trading price of our Class A ordinary shares or ADSs may fluctuate from time to time due to seasonality. Our use of some leased properties for offices and stores and for home rental business could be challenged by external parties or government authorities, which may cause interruptions to our business operations. Certain lessors of our leased properties for offices and stores, as well as lessors for our home rental services, have not provided us with their property ownership certificates or any other documentation proving their right to lease those properties to us. If our lessors are not the owners of the properties and they have not obtained consents from the owners or their lessors or permits from the government authorities, or our lessors are subject to property seizure or other proceedings that affect the properties, our leases could be invalidated. If this occurs, we may have to renegotiate the leases with the owners or the parties who have the right to lease the properties, and the terms of the new leases may be less favorable to us. We may not have entered into written contracts with our lessors properly for a few of our leased properties in a timely manner and the lessors of such properties may claim to terminate our leases. We may not be able to find alternative properties to lease in a timely and reliable manner, or at all. While some lessors have represented and warranted to us that they are the owners of the leased properties or have the legal rights to lease those property to us and have agreed to indemnify us against the losses resulting from the ownership defects or their failure to obtain the required approvals in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations, there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully enforce such indemnification obligations against the lessors or that such indemnification can cover losses from all the ownership defects. In addition, some of the leased properties may also be subject to mortgage at the time the leases were entered into. If no consent had been obtained from the mortgage holder under such circumstances, the lease might not be binding on the transferee of the property in the event that the mortgage holder forecloses on the mortgage and transfers the property to another party. In addition, a portion of our leasehold interests in leased properties have not been registered with the PRC governmental authorities as required by PRC law. The PRC governmental authorities may order us to register the lease agreements within a prescribed time limit. Failure to do so may subject us to a fine ranging from RMB1,000 to RMB10,000 for each lease agreement. As of the date of this annual report, we had not been ordered by any PRC governmental authorities to register any lease agreements and we do not expect the failure to register the lease agreements of these properties to be material to our business and results of operations in terms of revenue contribution. As of the date of this annual report, we are not aware of any material claims or actions being contemplated or initiated by government authorities, property owners or any other third parties with respect to our leasehold interests in or use of such properties. However, we cannot assure you that our use of such leased properties will not be challenged. In the event that our use of properties is successfully challenged, we may be subject to fines and forced to relocate the affected operations. In addition, we may become involved in disputes with the property owners or parties who otherwise have rights to or interests in our leased properties. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to find suitable replacement sites on terms acceptable to us on a timely basis, or at all, or that we will not be subject to material liability resulting from external parties challenges on our use of such properties. Our properties may be subject to safety risks. Our leased properties, including properties in relation to home renovation and furnishing business and centralized rental property management and operation services, transaction service centers and brokerage stores, must comply with fire safety regulations and pass necessary fire safety verifications or inspections. If any of the leased properties fails to pass such verifications or inspections, or otherwise does not comply with fire safety regulations, we may be exposed to significant fire safety risks and potential fire accidents. Safety risks with respect to leased properties, including our exhibiting and warehousing properties, transaction service centers, brokerage stores and leased properties under our home rental services, or properties that we help renovate and furnish may arise from unauthorized constructions, mezzanine additions and improper use of fire, electricity, gas or home appliance, aging of electrical circuits and spontaneous combustion of electrical appliances. Such risks or incidents could subject us to administrative penalties, forced closure of properties, interruptions to business operations, reputational harm, costs of rectification or, in the event of accidents, personal injuries, casualties and property damages. 49 Table of Contents Enforcement of stricter labor laws and regulations and increases in labor costs in the PRC may materially and adversely affect our business and our profitability. We expect that our labor costs, including wages and employee benefits, will continue to increase. Unless we are able to pass on these increased labor costs to our customers who pay for our services, our profitability and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Further, pursuant to the PRC Labor Contract Law, as amended, and its implementation rules, employers are subject to various requirements in terms of signing labor contracts, minimum wages, paying remuneration, determining the term of employees probation and unilaterally terminating labor contracts. In the event that we decide to terminate some of our employees or otherwise change our employment or labor practices, the PRC Labor Contract Law and its implementation rules may limit our ability to affect those changes in a desirable or cost-effective manner, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, under the PRC Social Insurance Law and the Regulations on the Administration of Housing Funds, employees are required to participate in pension insurance, work-related injury insurance, medical insurance, unemployment insurance, maternity insurance, and housing provident funds, and employers are required, together with their employees or separately, to pay the contributions to social insurance and housing provident funds for their employees. The government agencies may examine whether an employer has made adequate payments of the requisite statutory employee benefits, and employers who fail to make adequate payments may be subject to late payment fees, fines and/or other penalties. Certain of our PRC subsidiaries and the VIEs and their subsidiaries have failed to make social insurance and housing fund contributions in full for their employees. In addition, certain of our PRC subsidiaries and the VIEs engage third-party human resources agencies to make social insurance and housing fund contributions for some of their employees, and there is no assurance that such third-party agencies make such contributions in full in a timely manner, or at all. If the PRC authorities determine that we shall make up for social insurance and housing fund contributions or that we are subject to fines and legal sanctions in relation to our failure to make social insurance and housing fund contributions in full for our employees, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, pursuant to the PRC Labor Contract Law and the Interim Provisions on Labor Dispatch, dispatched labor is only intended to be a supplementary form of employment, the number of which shall not exceed 10% of the employers total labor force. See Item 4. Information on the CompanyB. Business OverviewRegulationRegulations Related to Employment and Social WelfareLabor Dispatch. We have historically hired dispatched workers from employment agencies from time to time and the number of dispatched workers may have exceeded 10% the total number of our labor force in the past. Although we aim to not assign dispatched workers on significant tasks, there is no assurance that the assignments performed by them are always temporary and ancillary in nature. We have formulated and implemented a plan to contain the number of dispatched workers and stay compliant. As of the date of this annual report, the number of our dispatched workers does not exceed 10% of the total number of our labor force. However, we cannot assure you that the number of dispatched workers we use will not exceed 10% of the total number of our labor force as we continue to develop and expand our business. If the number of our dispatched workers exceeds 10% of the total labor force in the future, we could be ordered to rectify within a specified period of time, and could be subject to fines if we fail to do so, which could have a material adverse effect to our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that our employment practices will be deemed to be in compliance with labor-related laws and regulations in China due to interpretation and implementation uncertainties related to the evolving labor laws and regulations, which may subject us to labor disputes or government investigations. If we are deemed to have violated labor laws and regulations, we could be required to provide additional compensation to our employees and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 50 Table of Contents Our online marketing services may constitute internet advertisement, which subjects us to laws, rules and regulations applicable to advertising. We derive certain amount of our revenues from online marketing services and other related services. In February 2023, the State Administration for Market Regulation promulgated the Administrative Measures on Internet Advertising, which became effective on May 1, 2023. Pursuant to the measures, internet advertisements are defined as any commercial advertising that directly or indirectly promotes goods or services through internet media in texts, images, audio, video or other forms. Under the measures, our online marketing services and other related services may constitute internet advertisement, and we may be therefore subject to additional obligations as an adverting distributor. For example, pursuant to the measures, an adverting distributor must examine, verify and record identity information of its advertisers, such as the advertisers name, address and contact information, and maintain an updated verification of such information on a regular basis. Moreover, it must examine the supporting documentation provided by the advertisers and adverting operators. Where a special government review is required for specific categories of advertisements before posting, the adverting distributor must confirm that the review has been performed and approval has been obtained, and no edits or changes to the advertisements are allowed unless they are re-approved by the authority. If the content of the advertisement is inconsistent with the supporting documentation, or the supporting documentation is incomplete, the advertisement cannot be published. As for pop-up advertisements, advertising distributors shall clearly indicate the close button for the advertisements, and shall not engage in any activities that may hinder the users from closing the pop-up advertisements with one click, such as lacking the close button, containing a countdown timer for close, providing false or unidentifiable marks for the close button, requiring more than one click to close, and allowing the advertisement to pop up again after it is closed on the same page or file, etc. In addition, the measures require paid-for search results to be distinguished from natural search results so that consumers will not be misled as to the nature of these search results. As such, we are obligated to distinguish from others the listings characterized as paid-for search results and the real estate brokerage brands, stores or agents who purchase online marketing and related services or the listings by these brands, stores or agents. Furthermore, the measures specify additional compliance requirements for internet advertising businesses. For example, any promotion in the name of knowledge or experience sharing or consumer review but containing links to purchase products and services are also classified as a form of advertisement and thus shall be clearly indicated as advertisements. Internet advertisements shall not deceive or mislead users into clicking or viewing the advertisements with false or fabricated system or software update reminders or warnings or offer of rewards. If an advertisement contains any link directing to another advertisement, the advertisers, advertising operators and distributors of primary advertisements are responsible for verifying the advertisement contents to which the link is directed and are relevant to the primary advertisement. Internet distributors shall also establish and maintain an archive for the advertisers and advertisements and keep the record for at least three years after the end of the advertisement. Violation of these laws, rules or regulations may result in penalties, including fines up to RMB2 million or of other amount calculated based on the amount of advertising fees, confiscation of advertising fees and orders to cease dissemination of the advertisements. In circumstances involving serious violations, the PRC government may suspend or revoke a violators business license or license for operating advertising business. Complying with the abovementioned requirements requires considerable resources and time, and could significantly affect the operation of our business, while at the same time also exposing us to increased liability under the laws, rules and regulations. The costs associated with complying with these laws, rules and regulations, including any penalties or fines for our failure to so comply if required, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose us to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on our business. Many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, we make statements about our goals and initiatives through our various non-financial reports, information provided on our website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside our control. We cannot guarantee that we will achieve our announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with our goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to achieve our goals, further our initiatives, adhere to our public statements, comply with environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against us and materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. 51 Table of Contents If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may lose investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. We are subject to reporting obligations under the U.S. securities laws. The SEC, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, adopted rules requiring every public company to include a management report on the companys internal control over financial reporting in its annual report, which contains managements assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. In addition, an independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting. Our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. See Item 15. Controls and Procedures. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report, which has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective in all material aspects as of December 31, 2024. However, if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, our management and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting at a reasonable assurance level. This could in turn result in loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and negatively impact the trading price of our Class A ordinary shares or the ADSs. Additionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and subject us to potential delisting from the stock exchanges on which we list, regulatory investigations and civil or criminal sanctions. We may also be required to restate our financial statements for prior periods. Furthermore, we have incurred and anticipate that we will continue to incur considerable costs, management time and other resources in an effort to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other requirements. We may need additional capital, and we may be unable to obtain such capital in a timely manner or on acceptable terms, or at all. Growing and operating our business will require significant cash investments, capital expenditures and commitments to respond to business challenges, including developing or enhancing new or existing services and technologies and expanding our infrastructure. If cash on hand and cash generated from operations and previous financing activities are not sufficient to meet our cash and liquidity needs, we may need to seek additional capital, potentially through debt or equity financings. We may not be able to raise required cash on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Such financings may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our shareholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the current market price per share of our ordinary shares. The holders of new securities may also have rights, preferences, or privileges that are senior to those of existing stockholders. If new financing sources are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, we may need to modify our growth and operating plans and business strategies based on available funding, if any, which would harm our ability to grow our business. The fair value measurements of short-term and long-term investments inherently involves a certain degree of uncertainty, and such investments may incur fair value losses. From time to time, we purchase short-term investments, which mainly include bank time deposits, investments in wealth management products issued by financial institutions and held-to-maturity investments issued by financial institutions, and long-term investments, which primarily include long-term time deposits, investments accounted for at fair values (such as long-term wealth management products and equity securities in publicly-listed companies) and available-for-sale debt investments. The methodologies that we use to assess the fair value of the short-term and long-term investments involve a significant degree of management judgment and are inherently uncertain. In addition, we are exposed to credit risks in relation to our short-term and long-term investments, which may adversely affect the net changes in their fair value. As of December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, we had short-term investments of RMB35.5 billion, RMB34.3 billion and RMB41.3 billion (US$5.7 billion), and long-term investments of RMB17.9 billion, RMB23.6 billion and RMB23.8 billion (US$3.3 billion), respectively. The impairment recorded for equity method investments was nil, RMB10.4 million and nil in 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The impairment recorded for equity investments accounted for using measurement alternative was RMB591.9 million, RMB28.8 million RMB9.4 million (US$1.3 million) in 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively. 52 Table of Contents Impairment loss charged against our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets could materially and adversely affect us. We may need to provide impairment losses for our goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets. Goodwill is not depreciated or amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests when an event occurs, or circumstances change that could indicate that the asset might be impaired. In accordance with the FASB, a company first has the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In the qualitative assessment, we consider primary factors such as industry and market considerations, overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and other specific information related to the operations. If we decide, as a result of our qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is mandatory. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The quantitative impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of each reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss equal to the difference will be recorded. Application of a goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. The judgment in estimating the fair value of reporting units includes estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and making other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit. We perform goodwill impairment testing at the reporting unit level on December 31 annually, and between annual tests whenever a triggering event occurs. Impairment charges of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets recognized for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024 were RMB148.1 million, RMB93.4 million and RMB151.6 million (US$20.8 million), respectively. If we incur significant impairment charges of goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets in the future, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. We are subject to risks associated with contract liabilities and deferred revenue. We had contract liabilities and deferred revenue of RMB3,260 million, RMB4,665 million and RMB6,052 million (US$829 million) as of December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively. Contract liabilities and deferred revenue are recognized if we receive consideration in advance of performance, which is mainly in relation to the existing home transaction services, new home transaction services, home renovation and furnishing services, home rental services and emerging and other services. If for any reason we were to become unable to fulfill a large amount of these contract liabilities and deferred revenue, we would have to refund the payments we received, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity position, and our brand image, reputation, and relationship with our platform participants might be damaged. If we are deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, it could adversely affect the price of the ADSs and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We are not an investment company and do not intend to become registered as an investment company under Section 3(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the Investment Company Act. We are primarily engaged in housing transactions and services, including existing and new home sales, home rentals, home renovation and furnishing, and other services. Under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act, a company may be deemed as an investment company if it is engaged, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. As a result, if we and/or certain of our subsidiaries are deemed to be an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act, we would have to dispose of investment securities in order to fall outside the definition of an investment company. Additionally, we may have to forego potential future acquisitions of interests in companies that may be deemed to be investment securities within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. Failure to avoid being deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, coupled with our inability as a foreign private issuer to register under the Investment Company Act, could make us unable to comply with our reporting obligations as a public company in the United States and lead to our being delisted from the NYSE, which would materially and adversely affect the liquidity and value of the ADSs. We would also be unable to raise capital through the sale of securities in the United States or to conduct business in the United States. In addition, we may be subject to SEC enforcement action or purported class action lawsuits for alleged violations of U.S. securities laws. Defending ourselves against any such enforcement action or lawsuits would require significant attention from our management and divert resources from our existing businesses and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 53 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure If the PRC government finds that the agreements that establish the structure for operating some of our operations in China do not comply with PRC regulations relating to the relevant industries, or if these regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations change in the future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations. Foreign ownership in entities that provide value-added telecommunication services, including online real estate platform services, is subject to restrictions under current PRC laws and regulations, unless certain exceptions are available. Specifically, foreign ownership of a value-added telecommunication service provider may not exceed 50%, except for the investment in the e-commerce operation business, a domestic multi-party communication business, an information storage and re-transmission business and a call center business. In addition, foreign investment in certain financial services in China is still heavily regulated. The relevant authorities retain the discretion in granting the approval of the change of a domestic company conducting certain financial services into a foreign-invested one. We are a Cayman Islands exempted company, and our PRC subsidiaries are considered foreign-invested enterprises. Accordingly, our PRC subsidiaries are not eligible to provide value-added telecommunication services and certain financial services subject to foreign ownership restriction under PRC laws or certain qualification requirements for foreign investors under other applicable PRC laws and regulations. To ensure compliance with the PRC laws and regulations, we conduct our foreign investment-restricted business in China through the VIEs and their subsidiaries, which currently hold the value-added telecommunication business license and other licenses necessary for our operation of such restricted business. Our applicable WFOEs have entered into a series of contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their applicable shareholders, respectively, which enable us to (i) direct activities of the VIEs that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIEs; (ii) receive economic benefits from the VIEs that could be significant to the VIEs; (iii) have the pledge right over the equity interests in the VIEs as the pledgee; and (iv) have an exclusive option to purchase all or part of the equity interests in and assets of the VIEs when and to the extent permitted by PRC law. As a result of these contractual arrangements, we have control over and are the primary beneficiary of the VIEs and hence consolidate their financial results under U.S. GAAP. See Item 4. Information on the CompanyC. Organizational Structure for further details. In the opinion of our PRC legal counsel, Han Kun Law Offices, as of the date of this annual report, (i) the ownership structures of our WFOEs and the VIEs in China are not in violation of provisions of applicable PRC laws and regulations currently in effect; and (ii) each of the agreements under the contractual arrangements among our WFOEs, the VIEs and their applicable shareholders governed by PRC law is not in violation of provisions of applicable PRC laws or regulations currently in effect, and valid and binding upon each party to such agreements and enforceable against each party thereto in accordance with their terms and applicable PRC laws and regulations currently in effect. However, we have been further advised by our PRC legal counsel that the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws, regulations and rules are evolving. Thus, the PRC governmental authorities may take a view contrary to the opinion of our PRC legal counsel. It is uncertain whether any new PRC laws or regulations relating to variable interest entity structure will be adopted or if adopted, what they would provide. For example, pursuant to the Overseas Listing Trial Measures and its five supporting guidelines issued by the CSRC on February 17, 2023 and became effective on March 31, 2023, domestic companies that seek to offer and list their securities in overseas markets, either in direct or indirect means, are required to file with the CSRC and report relevant information to the CSRC under certain circumstances. At the press conference held for these measures on February 17, 2023, officials from the CSRC clarified that, for companies seeking overseas offering and listing with VIEs and applying to file with the CSRC, the CSRC will solicit opinions from PRC regulatory authorities and complete the filing of the overseas listing of such companies if such companies duly meet the compliance requirements. If we fail to complete the filing with the CSRC in a timely manner or at all for our future capital raising activities which are subject to filing requirements under the measures due to the VIEs, we may be required to unwind the VIEs or adjust our business operations to meet the filing requirements and our ability to raise or utilize funds could be materially and adversely affected. However, as the measures were relatively new, it remains uncertain as to their interpretation, application, and enforcement, in particular, for companies with VIE structures, and how they will affect our operations in mainland China and our future capital raising activities. In addition, if we or the VIEs are found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, or fail to obtain or maintain any of the required permits or approvals to operate our business, the PRC governmental authorities would have the discretion to take action in dealing with such violations or failures in accordance with laws and regulations, including: revoking the business licenses and/or operating licenses of such entities; imposing fines on us; 54 Table of Contents confiscating any of our income that they deem to be obtained through illegal operations; discontinuing or placing restrictions or onerous conditions on the operations of the VIEs; placing restrictions on our right to collect revenues; shutting down our servers or blocking our app/websites; or requiring us to restructure our ownership structure or operations. Any of these events could cause significant disruption to our business operations and severely damage our reputation, which would in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If occurrences of any of these events results in our inability to direct the activities of the VIEs and their subsidiaries in China that most significantly impact their economic performance and/or our failure to receive the economic benefits and residual returns from the VIEs, and we are unable to restructure our ownership structure and operations in a satisfactory manner, we may not be able to consolidate the financial results of the VIEs in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. If the PRC government determines that the contractual arrangements constituting part of the VIE structure do not comply with PRC regulations, or if these regulations change or are interpreted differently in the future, our Class A ordinary shares and ADSs may decline in value or become worthless if we are unable to direct activities of or receive economic benefits the VIEs, which collectively held 34.2% of our groups cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and 10.9% of our groups total assets as of December 31, 2024 and contribute to 0.8% of our net revenues in 2024, excluding inter-group transactions. Our holding company in the Cayman Islands, the VIEs and investors of our company face risks about potential future actions by the PRC government that could affect the enforceability of the contractual arrangements with the VIEs and, consequently, significantly affect the financial performance of the VIEs and our company as a group. We rely on contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their shareholders to direct activities of the VIEs that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIEs and receive economic benefits from the VIEs that could be significant to the VIEs, which may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing operational control. We have relied and expect to continue to rely on contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their shareholders to conduct a portion of our operations in China, mainly value-added telecommunication services and certain financial services. These contractual arrangements, however, may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing us with control over the VIEs. For example, the VIEs and their shareholders could breach their contractual arrangements with us by, among other things, failing to conduct the operations of the VIEs in an acceptable manner or taking other actions that are detrimental to our interests. If we had direct ownership of the VIEs in China, we would be able to exercise our rights as a shareholder to effect changes in the board of directors of the VIEs, which in turn could implement changes, subject to any applicable fiduciary obligations, at the management and operational level. However, under the current contractual arrangements, we rely on the performance by the VIEs and their shareholders of their obligations under the contracts to direct activities of the VIEs that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIEs and receive economic benefits from the VIEs that could be significant to the VIEs. If any dispute relating to these contracts remains unresolved, we will have to enforce our rights under these contracts through the operations of PRC law and arbitration, litigation and other legal proceedings and it may be difficult to predict the outcome of such legal proceedings. See Any failure by the VIEs or their shareholders to perform their obligations under our contractual arrangements with them would have a material and adverse effect on part of our business. Any failure by the VIEs or their shareholders to perform their obligations under our contractual arrangements with them would have a material and adverse effect on part of our business. If the VIEs or their shareholders fail to perform their respective obligations under the contractual arrangements, we may have to incur substantial costs and expend additional resources to enforce such arrangements. We may also have to rely on legal remedies under PRC law, including seeking specific performance or injunctive relief, and contractual remedies, which we cannot assure you will be sufficient or effective. For example, if the shareholders of the VIEs were to refuse to transfer their equity interests in the VIEs to us or our designee when we exercise the purchase option pursuant to these contractual arrangements, or if they were otherwise to act in bad faith toward us, then we may have to take legal actions to compel them to perform their contractual obligations. 55 Table of Contents All the agreements under our contractual arrangements are governed by PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration in China. Accordingly, these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with PRC law and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures. We cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively enforce these contractual arrangements. See Risks Related to Doing Business in ChinaThe PRC legal system is evolving, which leads to uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect us. Meanwhile, there are very few precedents and little formal guidance as to how contractual arrangements in the context of a consolidated variable interest entity should be interpreted or enforced under PRC law. There are uncertainties regarding the ultimate outcome of such arbitration if legal action becomes necessary. In addition, under PRC law, rulings by arbitrators are final, parties cannot appeal the arbitration results in courts, and if the losing parties fail to carry out the arbitration awards within a prescribed time limit, the prevailing parties may only enforce the arbitration awards in PRC courts through arbitration award recognition proceedings, which would require additional expenses and delay. In the event we are unable to enforce these contractual arrangements, or if we suffer significant delay or other obstacles in the process of enforcing these contractual arrangements, we may not be able to direct activities of the VIEs that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIEs and receive economic benefits from the VIEs that could be significant to the VIEs, and our ability to conduct the business we currently conduct through the contractual arrangements may be negatively affected. Certain shareholders of the VIEs may have potential conflicts of interest with us, which may materially and adversely affect part of our business. Certain shareholders of the VIEs subject to the contractual arrangements may have actual or potential conflicts of interest with us. These shareholders may breach, or cause the VIEs to breach, or refuse to renew, the existing contractual arrangements we have with them and the VIEs, which would have a material and adverse effect on our ability to direct activities of the VIEs that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIEs and receive economic benefits from the VIEs that could be significant to the VIEs and receive economic benefits from them. For example, the shareholders may be able to cause our agreements with the VIEs to be performed in a manner adverse to us by, among other things, failing to remit payments due under the contractual arrangements to us on a timely basis. We cannot assure you that when conflicts of interest arise any or all of these shareholders will act in the best interests of our company or such conflicts will be resolved in our favor. We may invoke the right under the equity pledge agreements with the shareholders of the VIEs to enforce the equity pledge in the case of any shareholders breach of the contractual arrangements. For individuals who are also our directors and officers, we rely on them to abide by the laws of the Cayman Islands, which provide that directors and officers owe a fiduciary duty to the company that requires them to act in good faith and in what they believe to be the best interests of the company and not to use their position for personal gains. Certain shareholders of the VIEs have executed powers of attorney to appoint one of our WFOEs or a person designated by the respective WFOE to vote on their behalf and exercise voting rights as shareholders of the VIEs. If we cannot resolve any conflict of interest or dispute between us and the shareholders of the VIEs with these contractual arrangements, we would have to rely on legal proceedings, which could result in disruption of part of our business and subject us to substantial uncertainty as to the outcome of any such legal proceedings. The shareholders of the VIEs may be involved in personal disputes with third parties or other incidents that may have an adverse effect on their respective equity interests in the VIEs and the validity or enforceability of our contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their shareholders. For example, in the event that any of the individual shareholders of the VIEs divorces his or her spouse, the spouse may claim that the equity interest of the VIEs held by such shareholder is part of their community property and should be divided between such shareholder and the spouse. If such claim is supported by the court, the relevant equity interest may be obtained by the shareholders spouse or another third party who is not subject to obligations under our contractual arrangements, which could result in a loss of the ability to direct activities of the VIEs that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIEs and receive economic benefits from the VIEs that could be significant to the VIEs. Similarly, if any of the equity interests of the VIEs is inherited by a third party with whom the current contractual arrangements are not binding, we could lose our control over the VIEs or have to maintain such control by incurring unpredictable costs, which could cause significant disruption to part of our business and operations and harm our financial condition and results of operations. 56 Table of Contents Contractual arrangements we have entered into with the VIEs may be subject to scrutiny by the PRC tax authorities. A finding that we owe additional taxes could negatively affect our financial condition and the value of your investment. Under applicable PRC laws and regulations, arrangements and transactions among related parties may be subject to audit or challenge by the PRC tax authorities. We could face material and adverse tax consequences if the PRC tax authorities determine that the contractual arrangements in relation to the VIEs were not entered into on an arms-length basis in such a way as to result in an impermissible reduction in taxes under applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations, and adjust income of the VIEs in the form of a transfer pricing adjustment. A transfer pricing adjustment could, among other things, result in a reduction of expense deductions recorded by the VIEs for PRC tax purposes, which could in turn increase their tax liabilities without reducing our PRC subsidiaries tax expenses. In addition, the PRC tax authorities may impose late payment fees and other administrative sanctions on the VIEs for the adjusted but unpaid taxes according to the applicable regulations. Our financial position could be materially and adversely affected if the VIEs tax liabilities increase or if they are required to pay late payment fees and other penalties. We may lose the ability to use and benefit from assets held by the VIEs that are material or supplementary to the operation of our business if either of the VIEs goes bankrupt or becomes subject to dissolution or liquidation proceeding. As part of our contractual arrangements with the VIEs, these entities may in the future hold certain assets that are material or supplementary to the operation of our business. If either of the VIEs goes bankrupt and all or part of its assets become subject to liens or rights of creditors, we may be unable to continue some or all of our business activities we currently conduct through the contractual arrangement, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Under the contractual arrangements, the VIEs may not, in any manner, sell, transfer, mortgage or dispose of their assets or legal or beneficial interests in the business without our prior consent. If either of the VIEs undergoes voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceeding, unrelated creditors may claim rights to some or all of these assets, thereby hindering our ability to operate part of our business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The interpretation and implementation of the PRC Foreign Investment Law are evolving and we cannot assure you how it may impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance and operations. The value-added telecommunications services and certain financial services that we conduct through the VIEs and their subsidiaries are either subject to foreign investment restrictions set forth in the Special Management Measures (Negative List) for the Access of Foreign Investment (2024 Version) issued by the Ministry of Commerce and the NDRC, effective on November 1, 2024, or certain qualification requirements for foreign investors under other applicable PRC laws and regulations. On March 15, 2019, the National Peoples Congress promulgated the PRC Foreign Investment Law, which became effective on January 1, 2020. The interpretation and implementation of the law are subject to regulatory authorities. For instance, under this law, foreign investment refers to the investment activities directly or indirectly conducted by foreign individuals, enterprises or other entities in China. Though it does not explicitly classify contractual arrangements as a form of foreign investment, there is no assurance that foreign investment via contractual arrangements would not be interpreted as a type of indirect foreign investment activities in the future. In addition, the definition of foreign investment contains a catch-all provision which includes investments made by foreign investors through means stipulated in laws, administrative regulations or provisions of the State Council of the PRC. Therefore, it still leaves leeway for future laws, administrative regulations or provisions promulgated by the State Council of the PRC to provide for contractual arrangements as a form of foreign investment. In any of these cases, it will be uncertain whether our contractual arrangements will be deemed to be in violation of the market access requirements for foreign investment under the PRC laws and regulations. If further actions shall be taken under future laws, administrative regulations or provisions of the State Council of the PRC, we may face substantial uncertainties as to whether we can complete such actions. Failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our current corporate structure, corporate governance and operations. 57 Table of Contents Risks Related to Doing Business in China Changes in Chinas economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. We expect that our revenues will continue to be primarily derived in China and most of our operations will continue to be conducted in China. Accordingly, our results of operations, financial condition and prospects are influenced by economic, political, social conditions and legal developments in China generally and by continued economic growth in China as a whole. While the PRC economy has experienced significant growth over the past decades, there can be no assurance that the growth would be maintained or be even across different sectors. Any severe or prolonged slowdown in the rate of growth of the Chinese economy may adversely affect our business and results of operations, leading to reduction in demand for our services and solutions and adversely affect our competitive position. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth. Some of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy, while we cannot assure you how these measures would impact us. In the past the Chinese government has implemented certain measures, including interest rate adjustments, to control the pace of economic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in China, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our ability to successfully maintain or grow business operations in China depends on various factors, which may be beyond our control. These factors include, among others, macro-economic and other market conditions, political stability, social conditions, measures to control inflation or deflation, changes in the rate or method of taxation, changes in laws, regulations and administrative directives or their interpretation and changes in industry policies. If we fail to take timely and appropriate measures to adapt to any of the changes or challenges, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. The PRC legal system is evolving, which leads to uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect us. The PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. There is a limited volume of published court decisions that may be cited for reference but not binding on subsequent cases and have limited precedential value unless the Supreme Peoples Court otherwise provides. The overall effect of legislation over the past few decades has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign or private-sector investments in China. However, since these laws and regulations are relatively new and the PRC legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules may be subject to change. These evolvements and uncertainties may affect our judgment on the relevance of legal requirements and our ability to enforce our contractual rights or tort claims. For example, on December 29, 2023, the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress published the PRC Company Law (2023 Revision), which took effect on July 1, 2024. The PRC Company Law requires shareholders of a company to fully pay in their subscribed registered capital within five years of the establishment of the company. It also provides that companies established before the Company Law comes into force (i.e. July 1, 2024) with a term of capital contributions exceeding the aforementioned five-year period shall adjust their schedule of capital contribution to meet the new requirements, unless otherwise provided by laws and regulations or the State Council. The Provisions on Implementing the Registered Capital Registration and Management System under the PRC Company Law issued by the State Council of the PRC on July 1, 2024 further provide the detailed requirements and measures of the registration and management of registered capital under the PRC Company Law. If a company fails to adjust the period of capital contribution and its registered capital in accordance with these provisions, the competent enterprise registration authority may order such company to rectify. Furthermore, we may be required to fulfill our capital contribution obligations to our PRC subsidiaries or to provide financial support to the shareholders of the VIEs within a significantly shorter timeframe than currently stipulated pursuant to the PRC Company Law. 58 Table of Contents Besides, the PRC is geographically large and divided into various provinces and municipalities and, as such, the PRC laws, rules, regulations and policies are subject to interpretations of local regulatory authorities and the application and enforcement practice may be varying in different parts of the PRC. PRC laws and regulations, particularly in local applications, can change quickly and may be adopted upon announcement to the public. Furthermore, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and we may not be aware of our violation of these policies until sometime after the violation. Changes in government policies may create uncertainties that could adversely affect our business operations. The PRC administrative and judicial authorities have the discretion in interpreting, implementing or enforcing statutory rules and contractual terms, and it may be difficult to precisely predict the outcome of administrative and judicial proceedings. Given above, we may be required to take more responsibilities or meet additional requirements in the future than we currently expect, and may not be aware of our violation of any of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. Enforcement of agreements that are governed by PRC laws by legal or arbitral proceedings in the PRC could be complex with substantial costs incurred. In addition, any administrative and court proceedings in China may be time-consuming, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. The PRC governments oversight and discretion over our business operations could result in a material adverse change in our operations and the value of our securities. We conduct our business primarily through our PRC subsidiaries, the VIEs and their subsidiaries in China. Our operations in China are governed by PRC laws and regulations. The PRC government has significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of our business in accordance with PRC laws and regulations, and may influence our operations. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in a material adverse change in our operation and/or the value of our Class A ordinary shares or ADSs. In recent years, the PRC government has enhanced its oversight on overseas offerings and listings of China-based companies and foreign investment in China-based companies like us. Considering that a series of rules related to overseas listings by domestic companies are newly published and their interpretation and application remain uncertain, we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete filing with the CSRC or will be required to obtain any specific regulatory approvals from the CAC or any other PRC governmental authorities for our future financing activities in a timely manner, if at all, and such approvals and filings may be rescinded even if obtained. Any such circumstance could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. See Item 3. Key InformationD. Risk FactorsFilings, approvals or other administration requirements of the CSRC, the CAC or other PRC governmental authorities may be required in connection with our future offshore offerings under PRC law. Furthermore, the PRC government authorities are continually strengthening the oversight and law enforcement in recent years, such as enhancing joint supervision of governmental departments, systemically promulgating and implementing new rules, policies, guidelines and interpretations, and taking other comprehensive actions, which may affect our business model, monetization methods, daily operation, acquisition, investment and business development. In addition, implementation of industry-wide regulations may significantly affect the industries in which we operate, which could have material adverse effect in our operations and cause the value of our securities to significantly decline. Therefore, investors of our company and our business face potential uncertainty from actions taken by the PRC government affecting our business. Filings, approvals or other administration requirements of the CSRC, the CAC or other PRC governmental authorities may be required in connection with our future offshore offerings under PRC law. The PRC governmental authorities have strengthened oversight over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in overseas-listed China-based issuers like us. Such actions taken by the PRC government authorities may significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. For instance, the PRC governmental authorities promulgated the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down Illegal Securities Activities in Accordance with the Law. Pursuant to the opinions, the administration and supervision of overseas-listed China-based companies will be strengthened, and the special provisions of the State Council of the PRC on overseas issuance and listing of shares by such companies will be revised, clarifying the responsibilities of domestic industry regulators and regulatory authorities. 59 Table of Contents On February 17, 2023, the CSRC issued the Overseas Listing Trial Measures, and five supporting guidelines, which became effective on March 31, 2023. Pursuant to the measures, PRC domestic companies that directly or indirectly seek to offer or list their securities on an overseas stock exchange, including a PRC company limited by shares and an offshore company whose main business operations are in mainland China and intends to offer securities or be listed on an overseas stock exchange based on its onshore equities, assets, incomes or other similar interests, are required to file with the CSRC within three business days after submitting their application documents to the regulator in the place of intended listing or offering. Particularly, as for the PRC domestic companies that have directly or indirectly listed securities in overseas markets intend to conduct follow-on offerings in overseas markets, such companies are required to submit the filing with respect to the follow-on offering within three business days after completion of the follow-on offering. Failure to complete the filing under the measures, concealing any material fact or falsifying any major content in its filing documents may subject the company to administrative penalties, such as order to rectify, warnings, fines. Its controlling shareholders, actual controllers, direct officers-in-charge and other direct personnel-in-charge may also be subject to administrative penalties, such as warnings and fines. The measures also provide circumstances under which an overseas offering and listing of a PRC company is prohibited. At the press conference held for the measures, officials from the CSRC confirmed that the companies in mainland China that have been listed overseas before March 31, 2023 are not required to file with the CSRC immediately, but these companies should complete filing with the CSRC for their refinancing activities and future offerings in accordance with the measures. Based on the foregoing, as of the date of this annual report, we are not required to complete filing with the CSRC for our listing on the NYSE and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, but we may be subject to the filing requirements for our future capital raising activities under the measures. As the measures were relatively new, there remain uncertainties about how the measures will be interpreted or implemented and how they will affect our operations and future overseas offerings. We cannot assure you that we will be able to complete such filing in a timely manner and fully comply with such regulations to maintain the listing status of our ADSs and/or other securities, or to conduct any securities offerings in the future. On February 24, 2023, the CSRC, jointly with other governmental authorities, issued the Provisions on Strengthening the Confidentiality and Archive Management Work Relating to the Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, which became effective on March 31, 2023. These provisions expanded the applicable scope of the regulation to indirect overseas offerings and listings by companies based in mainland China and emphasized the confidentiality and archive management duties of such companies during the process of overseas offerings and listings. In addition, pursuant to Cybersecurity Review Measures, which were issued on December 28, 2021 and became effective on February 15, 2022, network platform operators holding over one million users personal information must apply with the Cybersecurity Review Office for a cybersecurity review before any listing on a foreign stock exchange. The cybersecurity review will evaluate, among others, the risk of critical information infrastructure, core data, important data, or a large amount of personal information being affected, controlled or maliciously used by foreign governments and the cyber information security risk in connection with the listing. The measures are subject to ongoing interpretation and their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. There can be no assurance that whether we should apply for cybersecurity review prior to any offshore offering and that we would be able to complete the applicable cybersecurity review procedures in a timely manner, or at all, if we are required to do so. In addition, on September 24, 2024, the CAC published the Measures on Network Data Security Management, which became effective on January 1, 2025. These measures provide that network data processors carrying out network data processing activities that affect or may affect national security shall undergo a national security review in accordance with relevant national regulations. However, there are still uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and implementation of the Measures on Network Data Security Management. 60 Table of Contents As of the date of this annual report, we have not received any formal inquiry, notice, warning, sanction, or any regulatory objection to any offshore offering from the CSRC, the CAC, or any other PRC regulatory agencies that have jurisdiction over our operations. If it is determined in the future that filings or approvals from the CSRC, the CAC, or other governmental requirements are required for our future offshore offerings, it is uncertain whether we can or how long it will take us to complete such filings or obtain such approvals, and any such approval could be rescinded even obtained. Any failure to complete such filings, or failure to obtain or delay in obtaining such approvals for our offshore offerings, or a rescission of any such approval obtained by us, would subject us to sanctions by the CSRC, the CAC, or other PRC regulatory agencies. These regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties on our operations in China, limit our ability to pay dividends outside of China, limit our operating privileges in China, delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from our offshore offerings into China, or take other actions that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects, as well as the trading price of our Class A ordinary shares or ADSs. In addition, if the CSRC, the CAC, or other regulatory agencies later promulgate new rules or explanations requiring filings, approvals, registrations or other kinds of authorizations for offshore offerings, we cannot assure you that we can complete the filings, obtain the approvals, authorizations, or complete required procedures or other requirements in a timely manner, or at all, or obtain any waiver of aforesaid governmental requirements if and when procedures are established to obtain such a waiver. Complying with new laws and regulations could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business. Any uncertainties and/or negative publicity regarding such an approval or other requirements could materially and adversely affect the trading price of our Class A ordinary shares or ADSs. We may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our PRC subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have, and any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to make payments to us could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business. We are a Cayman Islands holding company and rely on dividends and other distributions on equity from our PRC subsidiaries for our cash requirements, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders and service any debt we may incur. Current PRC regulations permit our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to us only out of their accumulated after-tax profits upon satisfaction of statutory conditions and procedures, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, each of our PRC subsidiaries is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds until the total amount set aside reaches 50% of its registered capital. Additionally, if our PRC subsidiaries incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing their debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. Furthermore, the PRC tax authorities may require our subsidiaries to adjust their taxable income under the contractual arrangements they currently have in place with the VIEs in a manner that would materially and adversely affect their ability to pay dividends and other distributions to us. Any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to distribute dividends or other payments to their respective shareholders could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our businesses, pay dividends or otherwise fund and conduct our business. The custodians or authorized users of our controlling non-tangible assets, including chops and seals, may fail to fulfill their responsibilities, or misappropriate or misuse these assets. Under PRC laws, legal documents for corporate transactions are executed using the chop or seal of the signing entity or with the signature of a legal representative whose designation is registered and filed with a branch of the State Administration for Market Regulation. In order to secure the use of our chops and seals, we have established internal control procedures and rules for using these chops and seals. In any event that the chops and seals are intended to be used, the responsible personnel will submit the application which will then be verified and approved by authorized employees in accordance with our internal control procedures and rules. In addition, in order to maintain the physical security of our chops, we generally have them stored in secure locations accessible only to authorized employees. Although we monitor such authorized employees, the procedures may not be sufficient to prevent all instances of abuse or negligence. There is a risk that our employees could abuse their authority, for example, by entering into a contract not approved by us or seeking to gain control of any of our subsidiaries or VIEs. If any employee obtains, misuses or misappropriates our chops and seals or other controlling non-tangible assets for whatever reason, we could experience disruption to our normal business operations. We may have to take corporate or legal action, which could involve significant time and resources to resolve and divert management from our operations. In addition, the affected entity may not be able to recover corporate assets that are sold or transferred out of our control in the event of such a misappropriation if a transferee relies on the apparent authority of the representative and acts in good faith. 61 Table of Contents PRC regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies may delay us from using the proceeds of our offshore offerings to make loans or additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries and to make loans to the VIEs, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business. Any funds we transfer to our PRC subsidiaries, either as a shareholder loan or as an increase in registered capital, as well as any loans we provide to the VIEs, are subject to approval by or registration with governmental authorities in China. According to the PRC regulations on foreign invested enterprises in China, capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries are subject to the registration with State Administration for Market Regulation or its local counterpart and registration with a local bank authorized by SAFE. In addition, (i) any foreign loan procured by our PRC subsidiaries is required to be registered with SAFE or its local branches and (ii) none of our PRC subsidiaries may procure loans which exceed the difference between its total investment amount and registered capital. Alternatively, our PRC subsidiaries can only procure loans subject to the calculation approach and limitation as provided by the Peoples Bank of China. Additionally, any medium or long-term loans to be provided by us to the VIEs must be registered with the NDRC and SAFE or its local branches. We may not be able to obtain these government approvals or complete such registrations in a timely manner, or at all, with respect to future capital contributions or foreign loans by us to our PRC subsidiaries or loans by us to the VIEs. If we fail to receive such approvals or complete such registration or filing, our ability to use the proceeds of our offshore offerings may be negatively affected, which could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business. Governmental regulation of currency conversion may limit our ability to utilize our revenues effectively and affect the value of your investment. The PRC government imposes regulations on the convertibility of Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China requires approval or registration in accordance with regulatory requirements. We receive our revenues primarily in Renminbi. Under our current corporate structure, our Cayman Islands holding company primarily relies on dividend payments from our PRC subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval of SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. Specifically, under the existing foreign exchange restrictions, without prior approval of SAFE, cash generated from the operations of our PRC subsidiaries in China may be used to pay dividends to our company. However, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we need to obtain SAFE approval to use cash generated from the operations of our PRC subsidiaries and VIEs to pay off their respective debt in a currency other than Renminbi owed to entities outside China, or to make other capital expenditure payments outside China in a currency other than Renminbi. We cannot guarantee that additional restrictions on the convertibility of the Renminbi into foreign currencies for the current account transactions will not be imposed in the future. If we are unable to obtain sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy our foreign currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our shareholders, including holders of our Class A ordinary shares or ADSs. We have very limited hedging options to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. We selectively use financial instruments to manage the market risks associated with exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency rates. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to adequately hedge our exposure or at all. In addition, our currency exchange losses may be magnified by exchange administration regulations in China that restrict our ability to convert Renminbi into foreign currency. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on your investment. 62 Table of Contents Chinas M&A Rules and certain other PRC regulations establish procedures and requirements for certain acquisitions of PRC companies, which could make it difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions in China. A number of PRC laws and regulations have established procedures and requirements for merger and acquisition activities in China by foreign investors. In addition to the Anti-Monopoly Law itself and ancillary regulations, these include the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rules, which became effective on September 8, 2006 and was amended on June 22, 2009, and the Rules of the Ministry of Commerce on Implementation of Security Review System of Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors promulgated in 2011. These laws and regulations impose requirements in some instances that the Ministry of Commerce be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise. In addition, pursuant to the Measures for the Security Review of Foreign Investment, which became effective on January 18, 2021, foreign investment in certain key areas with bearing on national security, such as important cultural products and services, important information technology and internet services and products, key technologies and other important areas with bearing on national security which results in the acquisition of de facto control of investee companies, shall be filed with a working mechanism office jointly established by NDRC and the Ministry of Commerce before such investment is carried out. In addition, pursuant to anti-monopoly laws and regulations, the State Administration for Market Regulation should be notified in advance of any concentration of undertaking if certain thresholds are triggered. In light of the evolvement of the interpretation, implementation and enforcement of the anti-monopoly laws and regulations of the PRC, we cannot assure you that the anti-monopoly law enforcement agency will not deem our future acquisitions or investments to have triggered filing requirement for anti-monopoly review. Moreover, the Rules of the Ministry of Commerce on Implementation of Security Review System of Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors specify that mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors that raise national defense and security concerns and mergers and acquisitions through which foreign investors may acquire de facto control over domestic enterprises that raise national security concerns are subject to strict review by the Ministry of Commerce, and prohibit any attempt to bypass a security review, including by structuring the transaction through a proxy or contractual control arrangement. Furthermore, if an overseas-listed China-based issuer like us conducts a follow-on offering for the purpose of purchasing assets in mainland China, the issuer shall also complete filing with the CSRC in accordance with the Overseas Listing Trial Measures. In the future, we may grow our business by acquiring complementary businesses. Complying with the requirements of the regulations to complete such transactions takes time, and any required approval and filing processes, including clearance from the State Administration for Market Regulation, approval from the Ministry of Commerce and NDRC and filing with the CSRC, may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions, which could affect our ability to expand our business or maintain our market share. F ailure to comply with PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident beneficial owners or our PRC subsidiaries to liability or penalties, limit our ability to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries, limit our PRC subsidiaries ability to increase their registered capital or distribute profits to us, or may otherwise adversely affect us. In July 2014, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment Through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, which requires PRC residents (including PRC individuals and PRC corporate entities) to register with SAFE or its local branches in connection with their establishment or control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas investment or financing with such PRC residents legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests. SAFE Circular 37 is applicable to our shareholders who are PRC residents and may be applicable to any offshore acquisitions that we make in the future. In addition, such PRC residents must update their SAFE registrations when the offshore special purpose vehicle undergoes material events relating to any change of basic information (including change of such PRC citizens or residents, name and operation term), increases or decreases in investment amount, transfers or exchanges of shares, or mergers or divisions. According to the Circular on Further Simplifying and Improving Foreign Exchange Administration Policy on Direct Investment, which became effective on June 1, 2015, applications for foreign exchange registration of inbound foreign direct investments and outbound overseas direct investments, including those required under SAFE Circular 37, will be filed with qualified banks instead of SAFE. The term control under SAFE Circular 37 is broadly defined as the operation rights, beneficiary rights or decision-making rights acquired by PRC residents in the offshore special purpose vehicles by means of acquisition, trust, proxy, voting rights, repurchase, convertible bonds or other arrangements. If any PRC shareholder of such special purpose vehicles fails to make the required registration or to update the previously filed registration, the subsidiary of such special purpose vehicles in China may be prohibited from distributing theirs profits or the proceeds from any capital reduction, share transfer or liquidation to the special purpose vehicles, and the special purpose vehicles may also be prohibited from making additional capital contributions into their subsidiary in China. 63 Table of Contents We have notified all individuals or entities who directly or indirectly hold shares in our Cayman Islands holding company and are known to us as PRC residents to complete the foreign exchange registrations. However, we may not be informed of the identities of all the PRC individuals or entities holding direct or indirect interest in our company, nor can we compel our beneficial owners to comply with the SAFE registration requirements. As a result, we cannot assure you that all of our shareholders or beneficial owners who are PRC residents have complied with, and will in the future make, obtain or update any applicable registrations or approvals required by the SAFE regulations. In addition, concerning the uncertainty of the application of SAFE Circular 37, some of our current beneficial owners who are PRC residents failed to complete or update their SAFE registrations to address the changes of their offshore interest. Failure by such shareholders or beneficial owners to comply with the SAFE regulations, or failure by us to amend the foreign exchange registrations of our PRC subsidiaries, could subject us to fines or legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities, limit our PRC subsidiaries ability to make distributions or pay dividends to us or affect our ownership structure, which could adversely affect our business and prospects. Any failure to comply with PRC regulations regarding the registration requirements for employee stock incentive plans may subject the PRC plan participants or us to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions. In February 2012, SAFE promulgated the Notices on Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plan of Overseas Publicly Listed Company. Pursuant to these rules, PRC citizens and non-PRC citizens who reside in China for a continuous period of not less than one year who participate in any stock incentive plan of an overseas publicly listed company, subject to a few exceptions, are required to register with SAFE through a domestic qualified agent, which could be the PRC subsidiaries of such overseas-listed company, and complete certain other procedures. See Item 4. Information on the CompanyB. Business OverviewRegulations Related to Foreign Exchange and Dividend Distribution Regulations Related to Stock Incentive Plans. We and our directors, executive officers and other employees who are PRC citizens or who reside in the PRC for a continuous period of not less than one year and who have been or will be granted incentive shares or options are subject to these regulations. Failure to complete the SAFE registrations may subject us or them to fines and legal sanctions. In addition, laws and regulations and their interpretation may change from time to time and there remains uncertainties with respect to their implementation, which could restrict our ability to adopt additional incentive plans for our directors, executive officers and employees under PRC law. If we are classified as a PRC resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, such classification could result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders and ADS holders. Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules, an enterprise established outside of the PRC with its de facto management body within the PRC is considered a resident enterprise and will be subject to the enterprise income tax on its global income at the rate of 25%. The implementation rules define the term de facto management body as the body that exercises full and substantial control and overall management over the business, productions, personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise. In 2009, the State Administration of Taxation issued a circular, known as SAT Circular 82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the de facto management body of a PRC-controlled enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in China. Although this circular only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups, not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners, the criteria set forth in the circular may reflect the State Administration of Taxations general position on how the de facto management body text should be applied in determining the tax resident status of all offshore enterprises. According to SAT Circular 82, an offshore incorporated enterprise controlled by a PRC enterprise or a PRC enterprise group will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having its de facto management body in China, and will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax on its global income only if all of the following conditions are met: (i) the primary location of the day-to-day operational management is in the PRC; (ii) decisions relating to the enterprises financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC; (iii) the enterprises primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and minutes of board and shareholder meetings are located or maintained in the PRC; and (iv) at least 50% of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in the PRC. 64 Table of Contents We believe none of our entities outside of China is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes. However, the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term de facto management body. If the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, we will be subject to PRC enterprise income on our worldwide income at the rate of 25% and we will be required to withhold a 10% withholding tax from dividends we pay to our shareholders that are non-resident enterprises, including the holders of our Class A ordinary shares and ADSs. In addition, gains realized on the sale or other disposition of our ADSs or Class A ordinary shares may be subject to PRC tax, at a rate of 10% in the case of non-PRC enterprises or 20% in the case of non-PRC individuals (in each case, subject to the clauses of any applicable tax treaty), if such gains are deemed to be from the PRC. It is unclear whether non-PRC shareholders of our company would be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and the PRC in the event that we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise. Any such tax may reduce the returns on your investment in our Class A ordinary shares or ADSs. We face uncertainty with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises by their non-PRC holding companies, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. On February 3, 2015, the State Administration of Taxation issued the Circular on Issues of Enterprise Income Tax on Indirect Transfers of Assets by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, or SAT Circular 7. SAT Circular 7 extends its tax jurisdiction to transactions involving the transfer of taxable assets through offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company. In addition, SAT Circular 7 provides certain criteria on how to assess reasonable commercial purposes and has introduced safe harbors for internal group restructurings and the purchase and sale of equity through a public securities market. SAT Circular 7 also brings challenges to both foreign transferor and transferee (or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer) of taxable assets. On October 17, 2017, the State Administration of Taxation issued the Circular on Issues of Tax Withholding Regarding Non-PRC Resident Enterprise Income Tax, or SAT Circular 37, which came into effect on December 1, 2017. SAT Circular 37 further clarifies the practice and procedure of the withholding of non-resident enterprise income tax. Where a non-resident enterprise transfers taxable assets indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, which is an Indirect Transfer, the non-resident enterprise as either transferor or transferee, or the PRC entity that directly owns the taxable assets, may report such Indirect Transfer to the tax authority. Using a substance over form principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring PRC tax. As a result, gains derived from such Indirect Transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer is obligated to withhold the applicable taxes, currently at a rate of 10% for the transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise. We face uncertainties as to the reporting and other implications of certain past and future transactions where PRC taxable assets are involved, such as offshore restructuring, sale of the shares in our offshore subsidiaries and investments. For transfer of shares in our company by investors who are non-PRC resident enterprises, our PRC subsidiaries may be requested to assist in the filing under SAT Circular 7 and/or SAT Circular 37. As a result, we may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with SAT Circular 7 and/or SAT Circular 37, or to establish that we and our non-PRC resident investors should not be taxed under these circulars, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. You may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing actions against us or our directors and officers named in the annual report based on foreign laws. We are an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, we conduct substantially all of our operations in China, and substantially all of our assets are located in China. A majority of our directors and executive officers are nationals or residents of jurisdictions other than the United States and most of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for a shareholder to effect service of process within the United States upon these individuals, to bring an action against us or these individuals in the United States, or to enforce against us or them judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States. 65 Table of Contents We have been advised by Harney Westwood & Riegels that although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the federal or state courts of the United States (and the Cayman Islands are not a party to any treaties for the reciprocal enforcement or recognition of such judgments), the Cayman Islands Grand Court will at common law enforce final and conclusive in personam judgments of state and/or federal courts of the United States of America, or the Foreign Court, of a debt or definite sum of money against the Company (other than a sum of money payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature, a fine or other penalty (which may include a multiple damages judgment in an anti-trust action) or where enforcement would be contrary to public policy). The Grand Court of the Cayman Islands may also at common law enforce final and conclusive in personam judgments of the Foreign Court that are non-monetary against the Company, for example, declaratory judgments ruling upon the true legal owner of shares in a Cayman Islands company. The Grand Court will exercise its discretion in the enforcement of non-money judgments by having regard to the circumstances, such as considering whether the principles of comity apply. To be treated as final and conclusive, any relevant judgment must be regarded as res judicata by the Foreign Court. A debt claim on a foreign judgment must be brought within 6 years of the date of the judgment, and arrears of interest on a judgment debt cannot be recovered after six years from the date on which the interest was due. The Cayman Islands courts are unlikely to enforce a judgment obtained from the Foreign Court under civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities law if such a judgment is found by the courts of the Cayman Islands to give rise to obligations to make payments that are penal or punitive in nature. Such a determination has not yet been made by the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands. A Cayman Islands court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. A judgment entered in default of appearance by a defendant who has had notice of the Foreign Courts intention to proceed may be final and conclusive notwithstanding that the Foreign Court has power to set aside its own judgment and despite the fact that it may be subject to an appeal the time-limit for which has not yet expired. The Grand Court may safeguard the defendants rights by granting a stay of execution pending any such appeal and may also grant interim injunctive relief as appropriate for the purpose of enforcement. Substantially all of our officers and directors are located in China, and it will be difficult to enforce liabilities and enforce judgments on those individuals. The recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the PRC Civil Procedures Law. PRC courts may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the PRC Civil Procedures Law based either on treaties between China and the country where the judgment is made or on principles of reciprocity between jurisdictions. China does not have any treaties or other written forms of reciprocity with the United States that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments. As such, the PRC courts will review and determine the applicability of the reciprocity principle on a case-by-case basis and the length of the procedure is uncertain. In addition, according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law, the PRC courts will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors and officers if they decide that the judgment violates the basic principles of PRC laws or national sovereignty, security or public interest. As a result, enforcement of a judgment rendered by a court in the United States is subject to the judgment of PRC courts considering the foregoing factors. In addition to the aforesaid substantial uncertainties, the foreign shareholders seeking the enforcement of a foreign judgment in the PRC courts could incur substantial legal and other costs that may be material to the shareholders. Shareholders could potentially spend a considerable amount of time and other resources to go through the recognition and enforcement procedure, which may be a significant burden for the shareholders, but with no assurance of ultimate success. As a result of all of the above, our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against our management, directors or major shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States. 66 Table of Contents It may be difficult for overseas regulators to conduct investigation or collect evidence within China. Shareholder claims or regulatory investigation that are common in the United States generally are difficult to pursue as a matter of law or practicality in China. For example, in China, there are legal and other obstacles to providing information needed for regulatory investigations or litigations initiated outside China. Although the authorities in China may establish a regulatory cooperation mechanism with the securities regulatory authorities of another country or region to implement cross-border supervision and administration, such cooperation with the securities regulatory authorities in the Unities States may not be efficient in the absence of mutual and practical cooperation mechanism. Furthermore, according to Article 177 of the PRC Securities Law which became effective in March 2020, no overseas securities regulator is allowed to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection activities within the territory of the PRC. The Provisions on Strengthening the Confidentiality and Archive Management Work Relating to the Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, which became effective on March 31, 2023, provide that the investigation and evidence collection in relation to the oversea securities offering and listing of the PRC domestic companies by the overseas securities regulatory authorities and other authorities shall be conducted through the cross-border cooperation mechanism for supervision and administration and the domestic companies in mainland China shall obtain the prior consent from the CSRC or other authorities before cooperating with such overseas securities regulatory authorities or authorities in connection with the inspections or investigations or providing documents to such overseas securities regulatory authorities or other authorities. The inability for an overseas securities regulator to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection activities within China may increase difficulties faced by you in protecting your interests. See also Risks Related to Our Shares and ADSsYou may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through Hong Kong or U.S. courts may be limited, because we are incorporated under Cayman Islands law. for risks associated with investing in us as a Cayman Islands exempted company. Discontinuation of any of the preferential tax treatments and government subsidies or imposition of any additional taxes and surcharges could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules, the statutory enterprise income tax rate is 25%, but certain high and new technology enterprises, are qualified for a preferential enterprise income tax rates subject to certain qualification criteria. A high and new technology enterprise, which is reassessed every three years, is entitled to favorable income tax rate of 15%. Currently, certain PRC subsidiaries of ours are enjoying favorable tax rates as high and new technology enterprises. If any of these entities fails to maintain its qualified status, the income tax rate could increase and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. Further, in the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to complex income tax and other tax regulations, and significant judgment is required in the determination of a provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax provisions are reasonable, if the PRC tax authorities successfully challenge our position and we are required to pay tax, interest and penalties in excess of our tax provisions, our financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. 67 Table of Contents The PCAOB had historically been unable to inspect our auditor in relation to their audit work performed for our financial statements and the inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections over our auditor in the past has deprived our investors with the benefits of such inspections. Our auditor, the independent registered public accounting firm that issues the audit report included elsewhere in this annual report, as an auditor of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, is subject to laws in the United States pursuant to which the PCAOB conducts regular inspections to assess its compliance with the applicable professional standards. The auditor is located in mainland China, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB was historically unable to conduct inspections and investigations completely before 2022. As a result, we and investors in the ADSs were deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in China in the past has made it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our independent registered public accounting firms audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to the PCAOB inspections. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB issued a report that vacated its December 16, 2021 determination and removed mainland China and Hong Kong from the list of jurisdictions where it is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms. As of the date of this annual report, the PCAOB has not issued any new determination that it is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in any jurisdiction. However, if the PCAOB determines in the future that it no longer has full access to inspect and investigate completely accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong, and we use an accounting firm headquartered in one of these jurisdictions to issue an audit report on our financial statements filed with the SEC, we and investors in our ADSs would be deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections again, which could cause investors and potential investors in the ADSs to lose confidence in our audit procedures and reported financial information and the quality of our financial statements. Our ADSs may be prohibited from trading in the United States under the HFCAA in the future if the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely auditors located in China. The delisting of the ADSs, or the threat of their being delisted, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment. Pursuant to the HFCAA, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, if the SEC determines that we have filed audit reports issued by a registered public accounting firm that has not been subject to inspections by the PCAOB for two consecutive years, the SEC will prohibit our shares or ADSs from being traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter trading market in the United States. On December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a report to notify the SEC of its determination that the PCAOB was unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong and our auditor was subject to that determination. In May 2022, the SEC conclusively listed us as a Commission-Identified Issuer under the HFCAA following the filing of our annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB removed mainland China and Hong Kong from the list of jurisdictions where it is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms. On December 29, 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 was signed into law, which amended the HFCAA (i) to reduce the number of consecutive non-inspection years required for triggering the prohibitions under the HFCAA from three years to two, and (ii) so that any foreign jurisdiction could be the reason why the PCAOB does not have complete access to inspect or investigate a companys auditors. As it was originally enacted, the HFCAA applied only if the PCAOBs inability to inspect or investigate because of a position taken by an authority in the foreign jurisdiction where the relevant public accounting firm is located. As a result of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, the HFCAA now also applies if the PCAOBs inability to inspect or investigate the relevant accounting firm is due to a position taken by an authority in any foreign jurisdiction. The denying jurisdiction does not need to be where the accounting firm is located. As of the date of this annual report, the PCAOB has not issued any new determination that it is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in any jurisdiction. For this reason, we were not identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer under the HFCAA after we filed our annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 or 2023, and do not expect to be so identified after we file this annual report on Form 20-F. 68 Table of Contents Each year, the PCAOB will determine whether it can inspect and investigate completely audit firms in mainland China and Hong Kong, among other jurisdictions. If the PCAOB determines in the future that it no longer has full access to inspect and investigate completely accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong and we use an accounting firm headquartered in one of these jurisdictions to issue an audit report on our financial statements filed with the SEC, we would be identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer following the filing of the annual report on Form 20-F for the relevant fiscal year. In accordance with the HFCAA, our securities would be prohibited from being traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter trading market in the United States if we are identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer for two consecutive years in the future. Although our Class A ordinary shares have been listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the ADSs and Class A ordinary shares are fully fungible, we cannot assure your that an active trading market for our Class A ordinary shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will be sustained or that the ADSs can be converted and traded with sufficient market recognition and liquidity, if our shares and ADSs are prohibited from trading in the United States. A prohibition of being able to trade in the United States would substantially impair your ability to sell or purchase our ADSs when you wish to do so, and the risk and uncertainty associated with delisting would have a negative impact on the price of our ADSs. Also, such a prohibition would significantly affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and prospects. The current tensions in international trade and rising international political tensions may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In recent years, there have been heightened trade and political tensions in international relations, particularly between the United States and China. These tensions have affected both diplomatic and economic ties between the two countries and created uncertainties to the international economy as a whole. Heightened tensions could reduce levels of trade, investments, technological exchanges, and other economic activities between major economies. The existing tensions and any further deterioration in the relationship between the United States and China and between other countries may have a negative impact on the general, economic, political, and social conditions around the globe, United States and China in particular, and thus adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The U.S. government has implemented policies restricting international trade and investment, such as tariffs, export controls, economic or trade sanctions, and foreign investment filing and approval requirements. These actions may materially and adversely affect international trade, global financial markets, and the stability of the global economic condition. In the past, the U.S. government has imposed higher tariffs on certain products imported from China to penalize China for what it characterizes as unfair trade practices. China has responded by imposing higher tariffs on certain products imported from the United States. On April 2, 2025, President Trump announced that the United States would impose a 10% tariff on most countries, effective on April 5, 2025, and individualized higher tariff rates on countries with which the United States has proportionately large trade deficits in goods, including, among others, a 34% additional tariff on goods imported from China. Following this action, China responded by imposing an additional tariff on goods imported from the United States, and the two countries sequentially further increased the additional tariff charged on each other, bringing the cumulative tariffs imposed on each other to over 100%. Other economies that are affected by increased tariffs by the United States are also considering imposing or increasing tariffs on goods from the United States, although after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on the individualized higher tariff rates for other countries, it is unclear how this situation will develop. As of the date of this annual report, there is still a high degree of uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariff policy, how it will be implemented, and how other countries will react to it. It also remains uncertain whether increased tariffs and trade tensions will create further disruptions and uncertainties to the international trade and lead to a downturn to the global economy. Although cross-border business may not be an area of our focus, if we plan to expand our business internationally in the future, any unfavorable government policies restricting international trade and investments may affect the demand for our products and services, impact our competitive position, or prevent us from being able to conduct business in certain countries. 69 Table of Contents In addition, the U.S. government has taken efforts to limit the outbound U.S. investments to China. On August 9, 2023, the Biden administration of the United States released an executive order directing the Department of Treasury to create an outbound foreign direct investment review program that would require reporting on or (in more narrow circumstances) prohibit investments by U.S. persons involving covered national security technologies and products. On October 28, 2024, the Department of Treasury issued a final rule to implement the executive order, providing details on technical specifications and other aspects of the operative regulations, which came into effect on January 2, 2025. This is referred to as the Outbound Investment Rule. The Outbound Investment Rule imposes investment prohibitions and notification requirements on U.S. persons for a wide range of investments in entities associated with countries of concern, currently only China, that are engaged in activities relating to (i) semiconductors and microelectronics, (ii) quantum information technologies, and (iii) artificial intelligence systems. These entities are collectively defined as Covered Foreign Persons. U.S. persons subject to the Outbound Investment Rule are prohibited from making, or required to report, transactions involving Covered Foreign Persons that are defined as covered transactions, although the Outbound Investment Rule excludes some investments from the scope of covered transactions, including those in publicly traded securities. The Outbound Investment Rule introduces new hurdles and uncertainties for cross-border collaborations, investments, and funding opportunities of China-based issuers including us. We do not believe that We do not believe KE Holdings Inc. would be defined as a Covered Foreign Person under the Outbound Investment Rule because we do not engage in a covered activity (as defined in the Outbound Investment Rule) or otherwise meet the definition of Covered Foreign Persons provided in the Outbound Investment Rule. However, there is no assurance that the U.S. Department of Treasury will take the same view as ours. If we were to be deemed a Covered Foreign Person, and if U.S. persons were to engage in a covered transaction (as defined under the Outbound Investment Rule) that involves the acquisition of our equity interests, such U.S. persons may need to make a notification pursuant to the Outbound Investment Rule. In addition, even though U.S. persons acquisitions of publicly traded securities (such as our ADSs) will be exempted from the scope of covered transactions under the Outbound Investment Rule, the rule could still limit our ability to raise capital or contingent equity capital from U.S. investors given that the relevant laws, regulations, and policies continue to evolve and we cannot rule out the possibility of being deemed a Covered Foreign Person in the future due to different views taken by the U.S. Department of Treasury, potential amendments to the Outbound Investment Rule or the introduction of additional regulations. For example, on February 21, 2025, the White House released President Trumps America First Investment Policy memorandum, outlining several initiatives to incentivize investment from U.S. allies and partners while restricting investments involving foreign adversaries, including China. Among other things, the policy aims to expand the industry sectors covered by the U.S. outbound investment regulations and supplement outbound restrictions through the imposition of sanctions. As of the date of this annual report, the proposed changes under the America First Investment Policy are not implemented, although the proposed restrictions may further deepen the uncertainties for cross-border collaborations, investments, and funding opportunities for China-based issuers including us. If our ability to raise such capital is significantly and negatively affected, it could be detrimental to our business, financial condition and prospects, and our ADSs may significantly decline in value. Risks Related to Our Shares and ADSs The trading price of the ADSs and Class A ordinary shares may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to investors. The trading price of our ADSs has been volatile since our ADSs started to trade on the New York Stock Exchange on August 13, 2020. The trading price of our ADSs could fluctuate widely due to factors beyond our control. The trading price of our Class A ordinary shares, likewise, can be volatile for similar or different reasons. This may happen because of broad market and industry factors, including the performance and fluctuation of the market prices of other companies with business operations located mainly in China that have listed their securities in the United States or Hong Kong. In addition to market and industry factors, the price and trading volume for the Class A ordinary shares or ADSs may be highly volatile for factors specific to our own operations, including the following: variations in our revenues, earnings, or cash flow; fluctuations in operating metrics; announcements of new investments, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures by us or our competitors, or failure to complete investments or acquisitions; announcements of new services and expansions by us or our competitors; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; 70 Table of Contents detrimental negative publicity about us, our competitors or our industry; additions or departures of key personnel; release of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding equity securities or sales of additional equity securities; regulatory developments affecting us or our industry and relating to overseas listing; potential litigation or regulatory investigations; the inclusion, exclusion or removal of our Class A ordinary shares in the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect and the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect programs, which are mutual stock market access mechanisms between mainland China and Hong Kong; trends of global and Chinas economies; rising international geopolitical tensions; and short selling of securities of China-based companies listed in the United States. Any of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the volume and price at which the Class A ordinary shares or ADSs will trade. Furthermore, the stock market in general experiences price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies like us. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our Class A ordinary shares or ADSs. Volatility or a lack of positive performance in our Class A ordinary shares or ADS price may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, most of whom have been granted equity incentives. Price volatility may cause the average price at which we repurchase our stock in a given period to exceed the stocks price at a given point in time. We believe the price of our stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. We also believe the price of our stock should reflect shareholder returns, including cash dividends and our share repurchase program. We cannot assure you that there will be future dividends, which are subject to declaration by our board of directors, and our share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares. If we fail to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of our stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence. In the past, shareholders of public companies have often brought securities class action suits against companies following periods of instability in the market price of their securities. Based on public records, our company and certain of our directors and officers were named as defendants in a putative securities class action filed in the United States. See Item 8. Financial InformationA. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial InformationLegal Proceedings for more information. When and if we are involved in a class action suit, it could divert a significant amount of our managements attention and other resources from our business and operations and require us to incur significant expenses to defend the suit, which could harm our results of operations. Any such class action suit, whether successful or not, could harm our reputation and restrict our ability to raise capital in the future. In addition, if a claim is successfully made against us, we may be required to pay significant damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our dual-class voting structure will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could discourage others from pursuing any change of control transactions that holders of our Class A ordinary shares and ADSs may view as beneficial. Our authorized and issued share capital are divided into Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares. In respect of matters requiring the votes of shareholders, holders of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares vote together as a single class except as may otherwise be required by law, and holders of Class A ordinary shares are entitled to one vote per share while holders of Class B ordinary shares are entitled to ten votes per share, subject to Rule 8A.24 of the Hong Kong Listing Rules that requires the reserved matters to be voted on a one vote per share basis. Each Class B ordinary share is convertible into one Class A ordinary share at any time by the holder thereof, while Class A ordinary shares are not convertible into Class B ordinary shares under any circumstances. Subject to the Hong Kong Listing Rules or other applicable laws or regulations, each Class B ordinary share shall be automatically converted into one Class A ordinary share upon the occurrence of any of the events as specified in paragraph 18 of our currently effective memorandum and articles of association. For details, see Item 10. Additional InformationB. Memorandum and Articles of Association. 71 Table of Contents As of February 28, 2025, holders of our Class B ordinary shares hold 144,042,476 Class B ordinary shares, representing 30.1% of the aggregate voting power of our total issued and outstanding ordinary shares (excluding the Class A ordinary shares registered in the name of the depositary bank for future issuance of ADSs upon the exercise or vesting of awards granted under our share incentive plans) due to the disparate voting powers associated with our dual-class voting structure. See Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and EmployeesE. Share Ownership. Holders of our Class B ordinary shares or their proxy have considerable influence over matters requiring shareholder approval, such as electing directors and approving material mergers, acquisitions, or other business combination transactions. This concentration of ownership may discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company, which could have the effect of depriving our other shareholders of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and may reduce the price of our Class A ordinary shares or ADSs. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could discourage others from pursuing any potential merger, takeover, or other change of control transactions that holders of Class A ordinary shares and ADSs may view as beneficial. If securities or industry analysts cease to publish research or reports about our business, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding the Class A ordinary shares or the ADSs, the market price for the Class A ordinary shares or the ADSs and trading volume could decline. The trading market for the Class A ordinary shares or the ADSs will be influenced by research or reports that industry or securities analysts publish about our business. If one or more analysts who cover us downgrade the Class A ordinary shares or the ADSs, the market price for the Class A ordinary shares or the ADSs would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which, in turn, could cause the market price or trading volume for the Class A ordinary shares or the ADSs to decline. Techniques employed by short sellers may drive down the market price of our Class A ordinary shares or the ADSs. Short selling is the practice of selling securities that a seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is in the short sellers interest for the price of the security to decline, many short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative opinions regarding relevant issuers and their business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling securities short. Public companies listed in the United States that have substantially all of their operations in China have been the subject of short selling. Much of the scrutiny and negative publicity has centered on allegations of a lack of effective internal control over financial reporting resulting in financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result, many of these companies are now conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations and, in the interim, are subject to shareholder lawsuits or SEC enforcement actions. On December 16, 2021, Muddy Waters Capital LLC issued a short seller report with allegations against us. On December 17, 2021, we announced that the audit committee of our board of directors commenced an internal review into the key allegations raised in the report with the assistance of third-party professional advisors including an international law firm and forensic accounting experts from a Big-Four accounting firm that is not our auditor. On January 28, 2022, we announced that the internal review was substantially complete and that based on such internal review, the audit committee has concluded that the allegations in the report were not substantiated. Any such allegations may be followed by periods of instability in the market price of our Class A ordinary shares or ADSs and the corresponding negative publicity. If and when become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we could be forced to expend a significant amount of resources to investigate such allegations or defend ourselves. While we would strongly defend against any such short seller attacks, we may be constrained in the manner in which we can proceed against the relevant short seller by principles of freedom of speech, applicable state law, or issues of commercial confidentiality. Such a situation could be costly and time-consuming and could distract our management from growing our business. Even if such allegations are ultimately proven to be groundless, allegations against us could severely impact our business operations and shareholders equity, and any investment in our Class A ordinary shares or the ADSs could be greatly reduced or rendered worthless. 72 Table of Contents We are subject to risks associated with class action suits, which may be expensive and could divert management attention. Shareholders of public companies have often brought securities class action suits against companies following periods of instability in the market price of their securities. For example, our company and certain of our directors and officers were named as defendants in a putative securities class action filed in the United States following the issuance of the December 16, 2021 Muddy Waters report. See Item 8. Financial InformationA. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial InformationLegal Proceedings for more information. Although we have reached an agreement in principle to settle all claims with the plaintiff, the settlement must be finalized and approved by the Court. If the settlement fails and the litigation continues, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or damages, if any, associated with the resolution of this lawsuit. Any adverse outcome of this case could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation, cash flows and reputation. We may continue to be the target of securities litigation in the future. Regardless of the outcome, any securities litigation against us, such as a class action lawsuit, could result in substantial costs and divert our managements attention from other business concerns, and, if adversely determined, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. You should primarily rely on price appreciation of our Class A ordinary shares and/or ADSs for return on your investment. We currently intend to retain a majority of our available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. Although we distributed dividends in the past, we cannot assure you that dividend will continue at current levels or grow. If we fail to meet expectations related to future dividends, the price of our stock may decline, which could have a material adverse impact on the investors. Our board of directors has complete discretion as to whether to distribute dividends, subject to certain requirements of Cayman Islands law. In addition, our shareholders may by ordinary resolution declare a dividend, but no dividend may exceed the amount recommended by our directors. Under Cayman Islands law, a Cayman Islands company may pay a dividend out of either profit or share premium account, provided that in no circumstances may a dividend be paid if this would result in the company being unable to pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. If our board of directors decides to declare and pay dividends, the timing, amount and form of future dividends, if any, will depend on our future results of operations and cash flow, our capital requirements and surplus, the amount of distributions, if any, received by us from our subsidiaries, our financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Accordingly, the return on your investment in our Class A ordinary shares or ADSs will likely depend largely upon any future price appreciation of our Class A ordinary shares or ADSs. There is no guarantee that our Class A ordinary shares or ADSs will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which you purchased the securities. You may not realize a return on your investment in our securities and you may even lose your entire investment. Substantial future sales or perceived potential sales of our Class A ordinary shares or the ADSs in the public market could cause the price of our Class A ordinary shares or the ADSs to decline. Sales of our Class A ordinary shares or the ADSs in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our Class A ordinary shares or the ADSs to decline. Shares held by our existing shareholders may be available for sale, subject to volume and other restrictions as applicable provided in Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act of 1933, or the Securities Act. We cannot predict what effect, if any, market sales of securities held by our significant shareholders or any other shareholder or the availability of these securities for future sale will have on the market price of our Class A ordinary shares or the ADSs. 73 Table of Contents Our currently effective memorandum and articles of association give us power to take certain actions that could discourage a third party from acquiring us, which could limit our shareholders opportunity to sell their shares, including Class A ordinary shares and ADS, at a premium. Our currently effective memorandum and articles of association contain provisions to limit the ability of others to acquire control of our company or cause us to engage in change-of-control transactions. These provisions could have the effect of depriving our shareholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices by discouraging third parties from seeking to obtain control of our company in a tender offer or similar transaction. Subject to the conditions that: (i) it is in compliance with the Hong Kong Listing Rules and the Codes on Takeovers and Mergers and Share Buy-backs; (ii) no new class of shares with voting rights superior to our Class A ordinary shares will be created; and (iii) any variations in the relative rights as between the different classes of our shares will not result in creating a new class of shares with voting rights superior to our Class A ordinary shares, our directors may issue from time to time, out of the authorised share capital of the Company (other than the authorised but unissued ordinary shares), series of preferred shares in their absolute discretion and without approval of our shareholders; provided, however, before any preferred shares of any such series are issued, our directors shall by resolution of directors determine, with respect to any series of preferred shares, the terms and rights of that series. Preferred shares could be issued quickly with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of management more difficult. Our board of directors may also issue Class A ordinary shares out of the authorised but unissued Class A ordinary shares in their absolute discretion and without approval of our shareholders, subject to the grant of a general mandate for such issuance by our shareholders from time to time. If our board of directors decides to issue preferred shares or additional Class A ordinary shares, the price of our Class A ordinary shares or ADSs may fall and the voting and other rights of the holders of our Class A ordinary shares and ADSs may be materially and adversely affected. The voting rights of holders of ADSs are limited by the terms of the deposit agreement, and you may not be able to exercise your right to direct the voting of the underlying ordinary shares represented by your ADSs. Holders of ADSs do not have the same rights as our registered shareholders. As a holder of ADSs, you will not have any direct right to attend general meetings of our shareholders or to cast any votes at such meetings. You will only be able to exercise the voting rights attached to the Class A ordinary shares underlying your ADSs indirectly by giving voting instructions to the depositary in accordance with the provisions of the deposit agreement. Where any matter is to be put to a vote at a general meeting, then upon receipt of your voting instructions, the depositary will try, as far as is practicable, to vote the underlying Class A ordinary shares represented by your ADSs in accordance with your instructions. You will not be able to directly exercise your right to vote with respect to the underlying Class A ordinary shares unless you cancel and withdraw the shares and become the registered holder of such shares prior to the record date for the general meeting. When a general meeting is convened, you may not receive sufficient advance notice of the meeting to withdraw the Class A ordinary shares represented by your ADSs and become the registered holder of such shares to allow you to attend the general meeting and to vote directly with respect to any specific matter or resolution to be considered and voted upon at the general meeting. In addition, under our currently effective memorandum and articles of association, for the purposes of determining those shareholders who are entitled to attend and vote at any general meeting, our directors may close our register of members and/or fix in advance a record date for such meeting, and such closure of our register of members or the setting of such a record date may prevent you from withdrawing the underlying Class A ordinary shares represented by your ADSs and from becoming the registered holder of such shares prior to the record date, so that you would not be able to attend the general meeting or to vote directly. Where any matter is to be put to a vote at a general meeting, upon our instruction the depositary will notify you of the upcoming vote and will arrange to deliver our voting materials to you. We cannot assure you that you will receive the voting materials in time to ensure that you can instruct the depositary to vote the underlying Class A ordinary shares represented by your ADSs. In addition, the depositary and its agents are not responsible for failing to carry out voting instructions or for their manner of carrying out your voting instructions. This means that you may not be able to exercise your right to direct how the underlying Class A ordinary shares represented by your ADSs are voted and you may have no legal remedy if the underlying Class A ordinary shares represented by your ADSs are not voted as you requested. In addition, in your capacity as an ADS holder, you will not be able to call a shareholders meeting. Under the deposit agreement, if no voting instruction from you is received, the depositary may give us a discretionary proxy to vote the Class A ordinary shares underlying the ADSs at shareholders meetings if we have timely provided the depositary with notice of meeting and related voting materials and (i) we have instructed the depositary that we wish a discretionary proxy to be given, (ii) we have informed the depositary that there is no substantial opposition as to a matter to be voted on at the meeting, and (iii) a matter to be voted on at the meeting would not have a material adverse impact on shareholders. 74 Table of Contents The effect of this discretionary proxy is that you cannot prevent our Class A ordinary shares underlying your ADSs from being voted, except under the circumstances described above. This may adversely affect your interests and make it more difficult for ADS holders to influence the management of our company. Holders of our Class A ordinary shares are not subject to this discretionary proxy. Transfer of our ADSs is subject to limitations. Our ADSs are transferable on the books of the depositary. However, the depositary may close its books at any time or from time to time when it deems expedient in connection with the performance of its duties. The depositary may close its books from time to time, including without limitation in connection with corporate action events, in emergencies, and on weekends and public holidays. The depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer or register transfers of the ADSs generally when our share register or the books of the depositary are closed, or at any time if we or the depositary thinks it is advisable to do so because of any requirement of law or of any government or governmental body, or under any provision of the deposit agreement, or for any other reason. You may experience dilution of your holdings due to inability to participate in rights offerings. We may, from time to time, distribute rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire securities. Under the deposit agreement, the depositary will not distribute rights to holders of ADSs unless the distribution and sale of rights and the securities to which these rights relate are either exempt from registration under the Securities Act with respect to all holders of ADSs, or are registered under the provisions of the Securities Act. The depositary may, but is not required to, attempt to sell these undistributed rights to third parties, and may allow the rights to lapse. We may be unable to establish an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, and we are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to these rights or underlying securities or to endeavor to have a registration statement declared effective. Accordingly, holders of ADSs may be unable to participate in our rights offerings and may experience dilution of their holdings as a result. You may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through Hong Kong or U.S. courts may be limited, because we are incorporated under Cayman Islands law. We are an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Our corporate affairs are governed by our currently effective memorandum and articles of association, the Companies Act (Revised) of the Cayman Islands, which we refer to as the Companies Act, and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take action against our directors, actions by our minority shareholders and the fiduciary duties of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from the common law of England, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority, but are not binding, on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary duties of our directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedents in Hong Kong or some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a less developed body of securities laws than Hong Kong or the United States. Some U.S. states, such as Delaware, have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law than the Cayman Islands. In addition, with respect to Cayman Islands companies, plaintiffs may face special obstacles, including but not limited to those relating to jurisdiction and standing, in attempting to assert derivative claims in a Hong Kong court or state or federal courts of the United States. Shareholders of Cayman Islands exempted companies like us have no general rights under Cayman Islands law to inspect corporate records (except for our memorandum and articles of association, our register of mortgages and charges and special resolutions of our shareholders) or to obtain copies of lists of shareholders of these companies. Our directors have discretion under our currently effective memorandum and articles of association to determine whether or not, and under what conditions, our corporate records may be inspected by our shareholders, but are not obliged to make them available to our shareholders. This may make it more difficult for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection with a proxy contest. As a result of all of the above, our public shareholders may have difficulties in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by management, members of our board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a company incorporated in Hong Kong and/or the United States. For a discussion of significant differences between the provisions of the Companies Act and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the United States and their shareholders, see Item 10. Additional InformationB. Memorandum and Articles of Association Differences in Corporate Law. 75 Table of Contents Your rights to pursue claims arising under the deposit agreement are limited by the terms of the deposit agreement. The deposit agreement governing the ADSs representing our Class A ordinary shares provides that, subject to the right to require a claim to be settled by arbitration, ADS holders waive the right to a jury trial of any claim they may have against us or the depositary arising out of or relating to our shares, the ADSs or the deposit agreement, including any claim under the U.S. federal securities laws, to the fullest extent permitted by law. If we or the depositary opposed a jury trial demand based on the waiver, the court would determine whether the waiver was enforceable based on the facts and circumstances of that case in accordance with the applicable state and federal law. To our knowledge, the enforceability of a contractual pre-dispute jury trial waiver in connection with claims arising under the federal securities laws has not been finally adjudicated by the United States Supreme Court. However, we believe that a contractual pre-dispute jury trial waiver provision is generally enforceable, including under the laws of the State of New York, which govern the deposit agreement, by a federal or state court in the City of New York, which has non-exclusive jurisdiction over matters arising under the deposit agreement. In determining whether to enforce a contractual pre-dispute jury trial waiver provision, courts will generally consider whether a party knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waive the right to a jury trial. We believe that this is the case with respect to the deposit agreement and the ADSs. It is advisable that you consult legal counsel regarding the jury waiver provision before entering into the deposit agreement. If you or any other owners or holders of ADSs bring a claim against us or the depositary in connection with matters arising under the deposit agreement or the ADSs, including claims under federal securities laws, you or such other owners or holders may not be entitled to a jury trial with respect to such claims, which may have the effect of limiting and discouraging lawsuits against us or the depositary. If a lawsuit is brought against us or the depositary under the deposit agreement, it may be heard only by a judge or justice of the applicable trial court, which would be conducted according to different civil procedures and may result in different outcomes than a trial by jury would have had, including results that could be less favorable to the plaintiff(s) in any such action. Nevertheless, if this jury trial waiver provision is not permitted by applicable law, an action could proceed under the terms of the deposit agreement with a jury trial. No condition, stipulation or provision of the deposit agreement or ADSs serves as a waiver by any owner or holder of ADSs or by us or the depositary of compliance with any substantive provision of the U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The deposit agreement also provides that ADS holders and the depositary have the right to elect to have any claim against us arising out of or relating to our Class A ordinary shares, ADSs, ADRs or the deposit agreement settled by arbitration in New York, New York rather than in a court of law, and to have any judgment rendered by the arbitrators entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitral tribunal in any such arbitration would not have the authority to award any consequential, special, or punitive damages or other damages not measured by the prevailing partys actual damages and may not make any ruling, finding or award that does not conform to the provisions of the deposit agreement. The deposit agreement does not give us the right to require that any claim, whether brought by us or against us, be arbitrated. The optional arbitration provision does not apply to claims under federal securities laws or claims other than in connection with our initial public offering or public offering of ADSs in November 2020. As an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, we are permitted to adopt certain home country practices in relation to corporate governance matters that differ significantly from the NYSE listing standards. As a Cayman Islands exempted company listed on the NYSE, we are subject to the NYSE listing standards, which require listed companies to have, among other things, a majority of their board members to be independent and independent director oversight of executive compensation and nomination of directors. However, NYSE rules permit a foreign private issuer like us to follow the corporate governance practices of its home country. Certain corporate governance practices in the Cayman Islands, which is our home country, may differ significantly from the NYSE listing standards. 76 Table of Contents We are permitted to elect to rely on home country practice to be exempted from the corporate governance requirements. Pursuant to the NYSE Listed Company Manual, a company listed on the NYSE must have a majority of independent directors, and a nominating/corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors. We currently follow our home country practice in lieu of those requirements. In January 2022, our board of directors approved the 2022 Share Incentive Plan, which became effective in May 2022. We followed our home country practice and did not convene a shareholder meeting to approve the 2022 Share Incentive Plan as required by the NYSE Listed Company Manual. In addition, we followed our home country practice and did not convene a shareholder meeting to approve the issuance of the restricted shares granted to Mr. PENG Yongdong and Mr. SHAN Yigang pursuant to the 2022 Share Incentive Plan as required by the NYSE Listed Company Manual. If we choose to follow home country practice in the future, our shareholders may be afforded less protection than they would otherwise enjoy if we complied fully with the NYSE listing standards. We are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act, and as such we are exempt from certain provisions applicable to U.S. domestic public companies. Because we qualify as a foreign private issuer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, we are exempt from certain provisions of the securities rules and regulations in the United States that are applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, including: the rules under the Exchange Act requiring the filing with the SEC of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form 8-K; the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents, or authorizations in respect of a security registered under the Exchange Act; the sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and liability for insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time; and the selective disclosure rules by issuers of material non-public information under Regulation FD. We are required to file an annual report on Form 20-F within four months of the end of each fiscal year. In addition, we intend to continue to publish our results on a quarterly basis as press releases, distributed pursuant to the rules and regulations of the NYSE. Press releases relating to financial results and material events will also be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K. However, the information we are required to file with or furnish to the SEC will be less extensive and less timely compared to that required to be filed with the SEC by U.S. domestic issuers. As a result, you may not be afforded the same protections or information that would be made available to you were you investing in a U.S. domestic issuer. There can be no assurance that we will not be a passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year, which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders of the ADSs or our Class A ordinary shares. A non-U.S. corporation, such as our company will be considered a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for any taxable year if either (i) at least 75% of its gross income is passive income or (ii) at least 50% of the value of its assets (generally based on an average of the quarterly values of the assets during a taxable year) is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income. Although the law in this regard is not entirely clear, we treat the consolidated VIEs and their subsidiaries as being owned by us for U.S. federal income tax purposes because, in accordance with contractual arrangements, we control their management decisions and are entitled to substantially all of the economic benefits associated with them. As a result, we have a controlling financial interest in the VIEs (as defined in FASB ASC 810), and we are considered the primary beneficiary of the VIEs for accounting purposes. We therefore consolidate their results of operations in the consolidated U.S. GAAP financial statements. If it were determined, however, that we are not the owner of the consolidated VIEs and their subsidiaries for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would likely be treated as a PFIC for the current taxable year and any subsequent taxable year. Assuming that we are the owner of the consolidated VIEs and their subsidiaries for U.S. federal income tax purposes and based on the current and anticipated value of our assets and the composition of our income and assets, including goodwill and unbooked intangibles, it is uncertain whether we were a PFIC for our taxable year ending 31, 2024, or will be a PFIC for the current or any future taxable year. No assurance can be given in this regard because the determination of whether we will be or become a PFIC is a factual determination made annually that will depend, in part, upon the composition of our income and assets and the value of our assets. 77 Table of Contents Fluctuations in the market price of the Class A ordinary shares or the ADSs may cause us to be or become a PFIC for the current or future taxable years because the value of our assets for purposes of the asset test, including the value of our goodwill and unbooked intangibles, may be determined by reference to the market price of the Class A ordinary shares or the ADSs from time to time (which may be volatile). The market price of our Class A ordinary shares or the ADSs may continue to fluctuate considerably and, consequently, we cannot assure you of our PFIC status for any taxable year. Furthermore, the composition of our income and assets may also be affected by how, and how quickly, we use our liquid assets. Under circumstances where our revenue from activities that produce passive income significantly increases relative to our revenue from activities that produce non-passive income, or where we determine not to deploy significant amounts of cash for active purposes, our risk of becoming a PFIC may substantially increase. Additionally, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service may challenge our classification of certain items of income, assets and liabilities, which may result in our company being or becoming a PFIC. If we are treated as a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. investor held an ADS or a Class A ordinary share, certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences could apply to the U.S. Holder.
