Operating Results Taxation PRC Withholding Tax of the 2025 Hong Kong Annual Report (adjusted version). We do not have specific cash management policies in place that dictate how funds are transferred between Alibaba Group Holding Limited, our subsidiaries, the VIEs or our investors. However, we have implemented procedures and control mechanisms to manage the transfer of funds within our organization to support our business needs and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. For the years ended March 31, 2023, 2024 and 2025, Alibaba Group Holding Limited provided capital contributions and loans, and repaid loans, in the aggregate amounts of RMB32,025 million, RMB74,951 million and RMB94,307 million (US$12,996 million), respectively, to our subsidiaries, and our subsidiaries provided dividends and loans, and repaid loans, in the aggregate amounts of RMB112,153 million, RMB193,629 million and RMB175,208 million (US$24,144 million), respectively, to Alibaba Group Holding Limited. For the years ended March 31, 2023, 2024 and 2025, our subsidiaries and consolidated entities provided loans and repaid loans, in the aggregate amounts of RMB21,283 million, RMB17,986 million and RMB29,008 million (US$3,997 million) to the major VIEs and their subsidiaries, and the major VIEs and their subsidiaries provided loans, repaid loans and paid technical service fees to our subsidiaries and consolidated entities in the aggregate amounts of RMB14,172 million, RMB25,432 million and RMB38,462 million (US$5,300 million), respectively. See The VIE Structure Adopted by Our Company Variable Interest Entity Financial Information for classification of cashflow detailed in footnotes to the condensed consolidating schedule. We have settled and will continue to settle fees under the contractual arrangements with the variable interest entities. For a condensed consolidating schedule of financial information that disaggregates the operations and depicts the financial position, cash flows, and results of operations for the same periods for which audited consolidated financial statements are required, see The VIE Structure Adopted by Our Company Variable Interest Entity Financial Information. Please also see the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for more financial information. 15 Table of Contents For fiscal year 2024, we declared a cash dividend in the amount of US$0.2075 per Share or US$1.66 per ADS, consisting of (i) a regular dividend in the amount of US$0.125 per Share or US$1.00 per ADS and (ii) a one-time extraordinary dividend in the amount of US$0.0825 per Share or US$0.66 per ADS as a distribution of proceeds from disposition of certain financial investments, for a total amount of US$4 billion.

Capitalization and Indebtedness Not Applicable. C. Reasons for the Offer and Use of Proceeds Not Applicable. D. Risk Factors Summary of Risk Factors Investing in our company may involve significant risks. Alibaba Group Holding Limited is a Cayman Islands holding company. It does not directly engage in business operations itself. Due to PRC legal restrictions on foreign ownership and investment in certain industries, we, similar to all other entities with foreign-incorporated holding company structures operating in our industry in China, operate through VIEs our Internet businesses and other businesses in which foreign investment is restricted or prohibited in the PRC. The VIEs are incorporated in the PRC and owned by PRC citizens or by PRC entities owned and/or controlled by PRC citizens, and not by our company. We have entered into certain contractual arrangements which collectively enable us to exercise effective control over the VIEs and realize substantially all of the economic risks and benefits arising from the VIEs. As a result, we include the financial results of each of the VIEs in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Investors in our ADSs and Shares are purchasing equity securities of a Cayman Islands holding company rather than equity securities issued by our consolidated subsidiaries and the VIEs. See Business Overview Organizational Structure of the 2025 Hong Kong Annual Report (adjusted version) for more details. See Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure of the 2025 Hong Kong Annual Report (adjusted version) for risks involving the VIE structure. In addition, we face various legal and operational risks and uncertainties as a company based in and primarily operating in China. The PRC government has significant authority to oversee and regulate the business operations of a China-based company like us, including overseas listing and overseas fundraisings. See Risk Factors Risks Related to Doing Business in the Peoples Republic of China of the 2025 Hong Kong Annual Report (adjusted version).

our reliance on dividends, loans and other distributions on equity paid by our operating subsidiaries in China, the risk that interventions in or the imposition of restrictions and limitations on the ability of us or our subsidiaries, or the VIEs by the PRC government to transfer cash or assets that are in a business in the PRC or in a PRC entity may limit our ability to fund operations or for other use outside of the PRC and fluctuations in exchange rates (see Risk Factors Risks Related to Doing Business in the Peoples Republic of China We rely to a significant extent on dividends, loans and other distributions on equity paid by our operating subsidiaries in China on page 149 of the 2025 Hong Kong Annual Report (adjusted version)) the possibility that we may be subject to PRC income tax on our global income, and potential discontinuation of preferential tax treatments we currently enjoy (see Risk Factors Risks Related to Doing Business in the Peoples Republic of China We may be treated as a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, and we may therefore be subject to PRC income tax on our global income on page 149 of the 2025 Hong Kong Annual Report (adjusted version)); the possibility that dividends payable to foreign investors and gains on the sale of our securities by our foreign investors may become subject to PRC taxation, and uncertainties with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises or other assets attributed to a PRC establishment of a non-PRC company (see Risk Factors Risks Related to Doing Business in the Peoples Republic of China Dividends payable to foreign investors and gains on the sale of our ADSs and/ or ordinary shares by our foreign investors may become subject to PRC taxation on page 149 of the 2025 Hong Kong Annual Report (adjusted version));

Risks related to our ADSs and Shares include risks and uncertainties associated with the following: volatilities in the trading prices of our securities, the substantial future sales or perceived potential sales of our securities, the sustainability of active trading markets for our securities, and the conversion of our convertible senior notes as well as the capped call transactions; changes to our shareholder return initiatives; different characteristics of the capital markets in Hong Kong and the U.S., and the possibility of a public offering and listing of our equity securities in Shanghai or Shenzhen; the limited ability of our shareholders and U.S. authorities to bring actions against us; our exemptions from certain NYSE corporate governance standards and certain disclosure requirements, as well as our different practices as to certain matters compared with many other companies listed in Hong Kong; potential limitations on the ability of ADS holders to vote, transfer ADSs and receive distributions on our ordinary shares, and our discretionary proxy from the depositary of our ADSs; the exchange between our Shares and our ADSs that may affect liquidity and/or trading prices of our securities and cause delays; the possibility that we may be or may become a passive foreign investment company; and uncertainty as to whether Hong Kong stamp duty will apply to the trading or conversion of our ADSs.
