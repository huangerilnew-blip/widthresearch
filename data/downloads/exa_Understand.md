## Introduction
Imagine you’re having a conversation with a customer service chatbot. You tell it your order number, explain your issue, and then ask a follow-up question. If the bot asks you to repeat your order number again, you’d probably be frustrated, right? This is exactly why memory management is crucial in conversational AI systems.
LangGraph, a powerful framework for building stateful multi-actor applications with large language models, provides sophisticated memory management capabilities that ensure your AI applications can maintain context across interactions. Whether you’re building a customer support bot, a personal assistant, or a complex multi-step workflow system, understanding how to effectively manage memory in LangGraph is essential for creating seamless user experiences.
In this guide, we’ll dive deep into LangGraph’s memory management system, exploring different types of memory, practical implementation strategies, and real-world use cases that will help you build more intelligent and context-aware applications.
